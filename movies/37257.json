Sir Wilfrid, recovering from a near-fatal heart attack, is *supposed* to be on a diet of bland, civil suits. But the lure of the criminal courts is too much for him, especially when the case is so difficult: Vole's only alibi witness is his wife, the calm and coldly calculating Christine Vole. Sir Wilfrid's task becomes even more impossible when Christine agrees to be a witness not for the defence but for the prosecution.", u'release_date': u'1957-12-17', u'popularity': 0.665746, u'original_title': u'Witness for the Prosecution', u'backdrop_path': u'/mL2oUFzs4qQOU6pNAxbKw6j0ux7.jpg', u'vote_count': 56, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.9, u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 9648], u'id': 37257, u'original_language': u'en'}
