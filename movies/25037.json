Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy\u2019s and she as young women of three consecutive generations\u2014a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver\u2014who inspire him. Colonel Blimp is both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor.', u'release_date': u'1943-06-10', u'popularity': 1.253161, u'original_title': u'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp', u'backdrop_path': u'/y0D50p2MwJAPwFilLlIe3CVLb7R.jpg', u'vote_count': 9, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.7, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749], u'id': 25037, u'original_language': u'en'}
