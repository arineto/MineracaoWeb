As the Jew\'s schemes grow more elaborate and his actions more brazen, the dukedom nearly erupts into civil war. Persuaded by the Jew, the Duke all but scuttles the constitution and alienates the assembly by lifting the local ban on Jews in Stuttgart. In a final outrage, the Jew rapes a wholesome German girl and tortures her father and fianc\xe9e. When the Duke succumbs to a sudden heart attack, the assembly of Elders try the Jew and sentence him to death for having "carnal knowledge of a Christian woman".', u'release_date': u'1940-09-24', u'popularity': 1.107817, u'original_title': u'Jud S\xfc\xdf', u'backdrop_path': u'/p4Qbb0jlBaxT884fc6zQJCvaKEB.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.3, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 8417, u'original_language': u'de'}
