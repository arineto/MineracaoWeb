Oshare decides she will be going to her aunt's house in the country instead. She brings with her her friends from school - Fanta (who likes to take pictures, and daydreams a lot), KunFuu (who has very good reflexes), Gari/Prof (who is a major nerd), Sweet (who likes to clean), Mac (who eats a lot), and Melody (a musician). However, the girls are unaware that Oshare's aunt is actually dead and the house is actually haunted. When they arrive at the house, crazy events take place and the girls disappear one by one while slowly discovering the secret behind all the madness.", u'release_date': u'1977-08-26', u'popularity': 1.14324, u'original_title': u'Hausu', u'backdrop_path': u'/htkxsqt90qwLchn266xgWOyDASJ.jpg', u'vote_count': 21, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [35, 14, 27], u'id': 25623, u'original_language': u'en'}
