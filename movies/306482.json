With the birth of a new baby brother weighing on his mind, Alexander begins to question Gregori\u2019s overpowering influence on the children and their training to become assassins. Threatened by his increasing unwillingness to fall in line, Gregori\u2019s behavior turns erratic and adversarial toward the child he once considered a son.
