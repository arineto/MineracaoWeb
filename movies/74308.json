{u'poster_path': u'/krmtqPYue29Dz6523jMqNu6TukC.jpg', u'title': u'Detachment', u'overview': u'Detachment is a chronicle of three weeks in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes. Henry roams from school to school, imparting modes of knowledge, but never staying long enough to form any semblance of sentient attachment. A perfect profession for one seeking to hide out in the open. One day Henry arrives at his next assignment. Upon his entry into this particular school, a secret world of emotion is awakened within him by three women. A girl named Meredith in his first period. A fellow teacher Ms. Madison, and a street hooker named Erica, whom Henry has personally granted brief shelter from the streets. Each one of these women, like Henry, are in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.', u'release_date': u'2011-04-25', u'popularity': 1.245649, u'original_title': u'Detachment', u'backdrop_path': u'/zVmWnAIlplmlTiZY9Bmo9kbX2mn.jpg', u'vote_count': 112, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 74308, u'original_language': u'en'}
