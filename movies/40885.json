The issue is compounded because a number of the soldiers become romantically involved with Japanese women, in defiance of US military policy. Ordinarily an officer who is by-the-book, Gruver must take a position when a buddy of his, an enlisted man Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) falls in love with a Japanese woman Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki) and marries her. Gruver risks his position by serving as best man at the wedding ceremony.', u'release_date': u'1957-12-05', u'popularity': 1.198909, u'original_title': u'Sayonara', u'backdrop_path': u'/oCg0vDcnzjyx8LswkH079mXnIga.jpg', u'vote_count': 5, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.4, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 40885, u'original_language': u'en'}
