{u'poster_path': u'/xI0ng1PmzFhvjk3hHafK4GutPJX.jpg', u'title': u'Home', u'overview': u"Marthe (Isabelle Huppert) and Michel (Olivier Gourmet) live with their three children in a house next to an abandoned highway. They use the deserted road as an extension to their property. One day without warning, construction workers begin to upgrade the road and the highway becomes open to traffic. Instead of leaving the house, the family continue to live there, despite the increased noise from the passing traffic. Their younger daughter, Marion (Madeleine Budd), becomes obsessed about the quality and cleanliness of her surroundings. The elder daughter, Judith (Ad\xe9la\xefde Leroux), continues to lead her life of sunbathing out on the front lawn in her bikini, despite attracting unwanted attention from passing motorists. One day she decides to leave the house and doesn't return. Meanwhile, the remaining family start to sound-proof their house by bricking themselves into the home. This includes blocking up all the windows and sealing all the ventilation points so no sound can get in.", u'release_date': u'2008-10-27', u'popularity': 1.102729, u'original_title': u'Home', u'backdrop_path': u'/bYqffdyOUydIDxjnx3djcDUqNyN.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 61222, u'original_language': u'de'}
