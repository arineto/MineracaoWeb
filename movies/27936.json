Avid movie-watcher and video store clerk Bazil has had his life all but ruined by weapons of war. His father was killed by a landmine in Morocco and one fateful night a stray bullet from a nearby shootout embeds itself in his skull, leaving him on the verge of instantaneous death. Losing his job and his home, Bazil wanders the streets until he meets Slammer, a pardoned convict who introduces him to a band of eccentric junkyard dealers including Calculator, a math expert and statistician, Buster, a record-holder in human cannonball feats, Tiny Pete, an artistic craftsman of automatons, and Elastic Girl, a sassy contortionist. When chance reveals to Bazil the two weapons manufacturers responsible for building the instruments of his destruction, he constructs a complex scheme for revenge that his newfound family is all too happy to help set in motion.', u'release_date': u'2009-10-28', u'popularity': 1.155891, u'original_title': u'Micmacs \xe0 tire-larigot', u'backdrop_path': u'/c3d53wTuRlUJP8HcSR2p5iAvXXe.jpg', u'vote_count': 46, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [28, 35, 80], u'id': 27936, u'original_language': u'fr'}
