Corby, has a plan: They'll make their way to a nearby river, build a raft, and then, under cover of night, float back to friendly territory. Their plans for getting back safely are sidetracked by a young woman who stumbles across them as they hide in the woods, and by the nearby presence of an enemy general who one member of the group is determined to kill.", u'release_date': u'1953-04-01', u'popularity': 1.285483, u'original_title': u'Fear and Desire', u'backdrop_path': u'/g8XMgGVc3mL3fDFjf8hKFUS3ox6.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.8, u'genre_ids': [18, 36], u'id': 10165, u'original_language': u'en'}
