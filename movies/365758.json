Surprises and challenges ensue, including drama with Alfreda's envious sister Mona Levi (Vivica A. Fox); the revelation of a deep, dark family secret involving Alfreda's former acquaintance Chivonne Price (Tichina Arnold); and dealings with Leighton's super-loud, outspoken cousin Nelson Royal (Ricky Harris). Unfortunately, Leighton and Alfreda both play their roles too well as old wounds are re-opened and their carefully planned reunion leads to chaos - and a potentially real break-up.", u'release_date': u'2015-11-21', u'popularity': 2.528151, u'original_title': u'Royal Family Thanksgiving', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [], u'id': 365758, u'original_language': u'en'}
