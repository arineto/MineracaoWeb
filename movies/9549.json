It covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once.", u'release_date': u'1983-10-21', u'popularity': 1.6637, u'original_title': u'The Right Stuff', u'backdrop_path': u'/yJ1ItKaKolReKVVIOvq9zlGwrV7.jpg', u'vote_count': 81, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 36], u'id': 9549, u'original_language': u'en'}
