A former business associate from Berlin's underworld pays a call asking Ripley's help in killing a rival. Ripley - ever a student of human nature - initiates a game to turn a mild and innocent local picture framer into a hit man. The artisan, Jonathan Trevanny, who's dying of cancer, has a wife, young son, and little to leave them. If Ripley draws Jonathan into the game, can Ripley maintain control? Does it stop at one killing? What if Ripley develops a conscience?", u'release_date': u'2002-09-02', u'popularity': 1.454636, u'original_title': u"Ripley's Game", u'backdrop_path': u'/wqM4JTpQxrM6uKw3PQqEky8gy7Y.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, u'genre_ids': [9648, 18, 53, 80], u'id': 10955, u'original_language': u'en'}
