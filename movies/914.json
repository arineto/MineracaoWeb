One of his masterfully drawn characters is a Jewish barber facing the constant threat of storm troopers and religious persecution. The other is the great dictator, Hynkel, a brilliant lampoon of Adolph Hitler that is awesome proof of Chaplin\'s pantomime genius. The movie\'s famous highlight comes in its final scene, when Chaplin steps out of character and addresses the camera with an eloquent plea for the triumph of reason and humanity over mindless militarism.', u'release_date': u'1940-10-15', u'popularity': 1.951664, u'original_title': u'The Great Dictator', u'backdrop_path': u'/qkpsvso2neEr7v6YnyMoZtm6R9F.jpg', u'vote_count': 245, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.7, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 914, u'original_language': u'en'}
