First, she is with Raoul, the older one; then passion for Cl\xe9ment, the younger doctor, takes over. Raoul fights back, playing on Cl\xe9ment's guilt and Juliette's lack of self-assurance; then, Cl\xe9ment makes his case to Juliette, abandons his fianc\xe9e, and takes her to the provinces where he sets up practice and asks her to have a baby. She panics and abruptly leaves Cl\xe9ment, taking up with Raoul again. When she contracts Hodgkin's disease and the treatment does no good, Raoul believes she has the malady of love.
