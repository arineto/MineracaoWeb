Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks - advised by his brilliant VP, Grace and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor, Guy - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around.", u'release_date': u'2014-12-19', u'popularity': 3.533859, u'original_title': u'Annie', u'backdrop_path': u'/hqNff5zochp9hzo299wC4Uoy8M9.jpg', u'vote_count': 195, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, u'genre_ids': [10402, 35, 18, 10751], u'id': 196867, u'original_language': u'en'}
