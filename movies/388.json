They work deliberately, without haste. Detective Frazier is assigned to negotiate, but his mind is occupied with the corruption charges he is facing.

Why aren't they in more of a hurry?", u'release_date': u'2006-03-24', u'popularity': 2.197413, u'original_title': u'Inside Man', u'backdrop_path': u'/6sLQFh6VFxU8nIkVaYg2yyJ6FL.jpg', u'vote_count': 543, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 53], u'id': 388, u'original_language': u'en'}
