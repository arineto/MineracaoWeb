He's back to takeaway Chinese for one after his girlfriend Linda (Marta Dusseldorp) abandoned him for a career in Sydney, a flashy Brisvegas type is muscling in on the racetrack action, and his cabinet-making still leaves a lot to be desired. So when an old teammate of his dad's turns up looking for help, it's a welcome distraction for Jack.  Des Connors' (Ron Jacobson) son Gary (Nicholas Coghlan) has gone missing, having nicked off with all Des's money. But sometimes prodigal sons go AWOL for a reason. As Jack begins to dig he discovers Gary was a man with something to hide and a very good reason to disappear - or be disappeared.\r .", u'release_date': u'2012-10-24', u'popularity': 1.11737, u'original_title': u'Jack Irish: Black Tide', u'backdrop_path': u'/uzW8F1X5NQldwT8wOqoH0zasMBd.jpg', u'vote_count': 2, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.5, u'genre_ids': [80, 18], u'id': 141099, u'original_language': u'en'}
