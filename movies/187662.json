Yamada was assistant director on Yazujir\u014d Ozu\u2019s T\u014dky\u014d monogatari, a moving family portrait set after the Second World War. In his remake, Yamada has made very few departures from Ozu\u2019s masterpiece in order to update the story of ageing couple Shukichi and Tomiko to present day Japan. Once again, the pair decides to leave their quiet lives in the country to pay a visit to their children and grandchildren in Tokyo. Once there, they discover that neither their oldest son, a doctor named Koichi, nor their eldest daughter Shigeko - who runs a beauty parlour - has time for them: both are too busy attending to their everyday concerns. Even the youngest son went his own way. The old couple feel lonely and bewildered in the fast-paced metropolis.', u'release_date': u'2013-01-18', u'popularity': 1.122286, u'original_title': u'\u6771\u4eac\u5bb6\u65cf', u'backdrop_path': u'/wM5gO1HQCwf3OmxSV8Pa1BtbTro.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.5, u'genre_ids': [18, 10751], u'id': 187662, u'original_language': u'ja'}
