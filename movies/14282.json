His fearsome abilities have served him well, but a hideous plot to overthrow the government threatens to end his wandering ways and possibly his life.  When a small village succumbs to a terrible plague, a team of ninjas are sent to investigate and realize that all is not as it seems. Ambushed, they are wiped uot by a fearsome man-monster with incredible powers, leaving only one alive - Kagero, a beautiful ninja whose touch can bring instant death. Jubei saves her from a fate worse than death and unwittingly becomes drawn into a web of treachery. He is soon faced with his greatest challenge, an enemy for whom death holds no fear with the power to destroy Jubei's world. It's an all-out bloodbath when ninja warriors come face to face in this action-packed tribal war.", u'release_date': u'1993-06-05', u'popularity': 0.326126, u'original_title': u'\u7363\u5175\u885b\u5fcd\u98a8\u5e16', u'backdrop_path': u'/lzMUucaNvgfWAUU7JxscKPeJLOq.jpg', u'vote_count': 42, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [28, 16, 14], u'id': 14282, u'original_language': u'ja'}
