Upon release, he discovers that his affairs with the underworld aren't completely settled, so he asks his brother Patrick to help him find a hideout where he can stay incognito and survive the dangerous elements that threaten him until the conflict blows over. A local priest named Patrick offers to let Mario stay with elderly Father Etienne in an Ardeche village. Mario follows suit, but is a bit perplexed to discover that Etienne has died and the villagers believe that Mario is the new priest", u'release_date': u'2009-04-29', u'popularity': 0.138243, u'original_title': u'Le Missionnaire', u'backdrop_path': u'/aKONBKMa7gO2y2yGcNGUAsPy7Pu.jpg', u'vote_count': 11, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 17417, u'original_language': u'fr'}
