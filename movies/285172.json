A fatal choice of partners ends up in a failed doping attempt, and a consequent kidnapping of the top horse Berlusconi. A bloodthirsty hunting party consisting of two eager financial crime investigators, an unscrupulous horse owner, two Finnish debt collectors, and a particularly unorthodox private investigator called The Animal, are scrambling to find the horse and those who have gone off with it. Bjarte's alibi is falling apart like a rotten racers suit, and his wifes bipolar fluctuations dont help much. What are the odds that a chubby harness racer may outsmart them all?", u'release_date': u'2014-09-12', u'popularity': 0.506814, u'original_title': u'Jakten p\xe5 Berlusconi', u'backdrop_path': u'/m40rGR7vNTr8LAdor0b2MVmkBFy.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 285172, u'original_language': u'no'}
