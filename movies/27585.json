Becca, an executive-turned-stay-at-home mother, tries to redefine her existence in a surreal landscape of well-meaning family and friends. Painful, poignant, and often funny, Becca's experiences lead her to find solace in a mysterious relationship with a troubled young comic-book artist, Jason - the teenage driver of the car that killed Danny. Becca's fixation with Jason pulls her away from memories of Danny, while Howie immerses himself in the past, seeking refuge in outsiders who offer him something Becca is unable to give. The Corbetts, both adrift, make surprising and dangerous choices as they choose a path that will determine their fate.", u'release_date': u'2010-12-16', u'popularity': 1.355234, u'original_title': u'Rabbit Hole', u'backdrop_path': u'/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg', u'vote_count': 45, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 27585, u'original_language': u'en'}
