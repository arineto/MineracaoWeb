Of course that last one is often the trickiest of all. Beth falls hard for Tommy (Porter), a sexy, young Wall Street hot-shot. But just as everything seems to be falling into place, complications arise in the form of Tommy's sensitive and handsome co-worker Daniel (Greenberg). Beth soon learns that the game of love in the big city is a lot like Wall Street -- high risk, high reward and everybody has an angle.", u'release_date': u'2009-04-25', u'popularity': 1.144631, u'original_title': u'The Good Guy', u'backdrop_path': u'/lUbst5qINYbuHp5o9fsevu5wrFq.jpg', u'vote_count': 25, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [35, 10749], u'id': 39037, u'original_language': u'en'}
