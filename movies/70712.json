She also knows the exact date in which she'll die: April 30. What Laura doesn't know is what she'll do from now till then, and thus she enrolls in a group of optimists, which she finds pathetic but fun. In that group she writes a list of 10 things she wants to do before she dies, some that mean a lot and some that are a lot of fun. The first thing on her list is to save a life.", u'release_date': u'2010-10-29', u'popularity': 0.102817, u'original_title': u'Te presento a Laura', u'backdrop_path': u'/5spADABd1xdrIyywyhOoyrl7gM6.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749], u'id': 70712, u'original_language': u'en'}
