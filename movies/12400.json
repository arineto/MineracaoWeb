His Brazilian wife, whose family promotes fights, wants to see Mike in the ring making money, but to him competition is degrading. A woman sideswipes Mike's car and then, after an odd sequence of events, shoots out the studio's window. Later that evening, Mike rescues an action movie star in a fistfight at a bar. In return, the actor befriends Mike, gives him a gift, offers him work on his newest film, and introduces Mike's wife to his own - the women initiate business dealings. Then, things go sour all at once, Mike's debts mount, and going into the ring may be his only option.", u'release_date': u'2008-04-07', u'popularity': 1.227029, u'original_title': u'Redbelt', u'backdrop_path': u'/68SA1sd5HbHaMDwTO0wH8Bwdxdf.jpg', u'vote_count': 21, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 12400, u'original_language': u'en'}
