During this intensely condensed period, a lifetime of drama plays out. Robert (Jenkins) fights a zero sum game to reclaim all that his illness stole from his family. A debate rages on patients\u2019 rights and what it truly means to be free. Jonathan reconciles with his father, reconnects with his mother (Archer), sister (Brown-Findlay), and his love (Adams) and reclaims his voice through two unlikely catalysts \u2013 a young, wise-beyond-her-years patient (Barden) and a no-nonsense nurse (Hudson). Through this intensely life affirming prism, an unexpected and powerful journey of love, laughter, and forgiveness unfolds.', u'release_date': u'2014-06-13', u'popularity': 0.099437, u'original_title': u'Lullaby', u'backdrop_path': u'/jr2hnFk46ocv7Z1Dqk2152GeGuN.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 261768, u'original_language': u'en'}
