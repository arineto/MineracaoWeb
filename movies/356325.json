{u'poster_path': None, u'title': u'Everything Is Copy', u'overview': u'Jacob Bernstein\'s extremely entertaining film is a tribute to his mother Nora Ephron: Hollywood-raised daughter of screenwriters who grew up to be an ace reporter turned piercingly funny essayist turned novelist/screenwriter/playwright/director. Ephron comes vibrantly alive onscreen via her words; the memories of her sisters, colleagues, former spouses, and many friends; scenes from her movies; and, above all, her own inimitable presence. Watch any given moment of Ephron being her sparkling but caustically witty self (for instance, this response to a scolding talk show host\u2014"You have a soft spot for Julie Nixon, don\'t you. See, I don\'t...") and you find it hard to believe that she\u2019s been gone from our midst for three years. Everything Is Copy (Ephron\'s motto, inherited from her mother) is a lovingly drawn but frank portrait and, incidentally, a vivid snapshot of an earlier, livelier, bitchier, and funnier moment in New York culture.', u'release_date': u'2015-09-29', u'popularity': 1.099918, u'original_title': u'Everything Is Copy', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [99], u'id': 356325, u'original_language': u'en'}
