She is a beautiful, silent outsider who's moved to this Sicilian town to be with her husband, Nico. He promptly goes off to war, leaving her to the lustful eyes of the men and the sharp tongues of the women. During the next few years, as Renato grows toward manhood, he watches Mal\xe8na suffer and prove her mettle. He sees her loneliness, then grief when Nico is reported dead, the effects of slander on her relationship with her father, her poverty and search for work, and final humiliations. Will Renato learn courage from Mal\xe8na and stand up for her?", u'release_date': u'2000-10-27', u'popularity': 1.894451, u'original_title': u'Malena', u'backdrop_path': u'/7AnyXIa6M55ZRT7kMvy10umEcD7.jpg', u'vote_count': 90, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 10867, u'original_language': u'en'}
