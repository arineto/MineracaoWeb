Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.", u'release_date': u'2015-05-15', u'popularity': 18.240142, u'original_title': u'Mad Max: Fury Road', u'backdrop_path': u'/tbhdm8UJAb4ViCTsulYFL3lxMCd.jpg', u'vote_count': 2766, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.6, u'genre_ids': [53, 28, 12], u'id': 76341, u'original_language': u'en'}
