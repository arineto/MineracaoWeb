Born on a Baja, California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from afar. Based on the actual trajectory of a sea turtle's life, the film illustrates the dangers humans pose to the species' survival. The film combines entertainment with an important environmental message.", u'release_date': u'2011-03-25', u'popularity': 1.559859, u'original_title': u"Sammy's avonturen: De geheime doorgang", u'backdrop_path': u'/idEOJz8WCuRpxNunYjjvCP8FI2y.jpg', u'vote_count': 48, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [16, 10751], u'id': 49953, u'original_language': u'en'}
