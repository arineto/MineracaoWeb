Frightened of being separated by child services following the death of their mother, a self-sufficient 16-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother - who hasn't spoken a word since seeing his father killed by the mayor - strive to live off the land in peace. Their innocence is shattered, however, when a group of hunters led by the mayor's son brutalizes and rapes the free-spirited girl. Later, when a well-meaning social services worker arrives too late to protect the terrorized siblings, the girl and her brother prepare to take a stand against their ruthless attackers.", u'release_date': u'2013-09-10', u'popularity': 0.112794, u'original_title': u'Autumn Blood', u'backdrop_path': u'/yUOkLhsy3K8MmdHnR5p8HlKXrmE.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, u'genre_ids': [18, 53], u'id': 237614, u'original_language': u'en'}
