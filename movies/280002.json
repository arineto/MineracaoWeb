The first of a series of religious-slanted horror movies aimed at devout audiences, THE REMAINING is a surprisingly effective disaster shocker based on the Book of Revelations, produced by the makers of DONNIE DARKO and URBAN LEGEND. When a group of close-knit friends assemble for the marriage of Skylar and Dan, they have no idea they will witness The Rapture and face a series of catastrophic events turning the celebration into a life-or-death struggle. Scrambling for sanctuary and self-preservation while an army of nocturnal creatures they never knew existed unleashes epic destruction, they must understand what is happening around them, and why, to find a way to survive together in a new world order. Witness the birth of a new genre: horror containing spiritually rich content with faith-based appeal.', u'release_date': u'2014-08-25', u'popularity': 0.126619, u'original_title': u'The Remaining', u'backdrop_path': u'/j1wEyEwVc6GwnylWGjn4cSkEQue.jpg', u'vote_count': 51, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.2, u'genre_ids': [27, 53], u'id': 280002, u'original_language': u'en'}
