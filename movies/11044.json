This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there, but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding. It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet turtles", u'release_date': u'1992-10-26', u'popularity': 0.376557, u'original_title': u'Arizona Dream', u'backdrop_path': u'/wKa1vwRkujY067dqqIgdWlgCuaH.jpg', u'vote_count': 49, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 14, 10749], u'id': 11044, u'original_language': u'en'}
