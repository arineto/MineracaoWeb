{u'poster_path': u'/dQ4WsB5DBozZfEIjjD79qam43du.jpg', u'title': u'Wicked City', u'overview': u'This animated Japanese film is a dark, adult-oriented thriller. A peace treaty between the Earth and the Black World, a parallel universe of spider-like aliens is coming to an end. Two cops, Taki, a human male, and Maki, a female alien, are assigned to protect a diplomat who will help secure another treaty. A radical group of aliens from the Black World are out to assassinate the diplomat and prevent the treaty; only the bond that forms between the two cops can save the Earth from destruction. Sex is strongly associated with violence in many graphic scenes; although this is intended to play a symbolic role, this theme is used excessively. The story is effective, but the film is definitely not for children or anyone easily offended.', u'release_date': u'1987-04-19', u'popularity': 0.234024, u'original_title': u'Y\xf4j\xfb toshi', u'backdrop_path': u'/uyTlb9KsnDRjIHMFaolQggLkpXC.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [16, 14, 27, 53], u'id': 21453, u'original_language': u'en'}
