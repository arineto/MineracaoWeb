The more the ambitious Assistant District Attorney Judith (32) learns about this, as it turns out, ex-prostitute, the more she\u2019s disgusted by this woman who murders mortally ill seniors and babies. The newspapers are full of it. The District Attorney gives Judith the freedom to lead the investigation into this \u2018Angel of Death\u2019. She is finally assigned the case that could get her promoted: the case of Lucia de B. \xa0 As assistant to the District Attorney Judith puts her all into an exhausting investigation. The verdict is gripping. Lucia is sentenced to life for four murders and three attempted murders. Judith enjoys the victory, because this will surely lead to her promotion to District Attorney. \xa0But then doubt hits her.', u'release_date': u'2014-03-27', u'popularity': 1.105305, u'original_title': u'Lucia de B.', u'backdrop_path': u'/rkNspsuMy68dF64dMk4s128dE3Q.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [18, 53], u'id': 242065, u'original_language': u'nl'}
