There are three main characters at the heart of the action: a member of the GIGN, Carole Jeanton, an ambitious technocrat willing to do anything it takes to achieve personal gain from the events, and Yahia Abdallah, a determined jihadist who grew up in the slums of Algiers and was being manipulated by an obscure GIA envoy, Ali Touchent.', u'release_date': u'2010-11-12', u'popularity': 1.277225, u'original_title': u"L'assaut", u'backdrop_path': u'/HXp4vg2V3N1xIJZWc8nW7AbezJ.jpg', u'vote_count': 27, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [28, 53], u'id': 59145, u'original_language': u'fr'}
