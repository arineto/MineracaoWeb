{u'poster_path': u'/zKdVejqnpbWCyoQnudb8R0o9bMx.jpg', u'title': u"Gentleman's Agreement", u'overview': u"Philip Green is a highly respected writer who is recruited by a national magazine to write a series of articles on anti-Semitism in America. He's not too keen on the series, mostly because he's not sure how to tackle the subject. Then it dawns on him: if he was to pretend to all and sundry that he was Jewish, he could then experience the degree of racism and prejudice that exists and write his story from that perspective. It takes little time for him to experience bigotry. He soon learns the liberal-minded firm he works for doesn't hire Jews and that his own secretary changed her name and kept the fact that she is Jewish a secret from everyone. Green soon finds that he won't be invited to certain parties, that he cannot stay in so-called 'restricted' hotels and that his own son is called names in the street. His anger at the way he is treated also affects his relationship with Kathy Lacy, his publisher's niece and the person who suggested the series in the first place.", u'release_date': u'1947-11-11', u'popularity': 0.200678, u'original_title': u"Gentleman's Agreement", u'backdrop_path': u'/3DNb1C2NHf5Sbrk5LbuNJydTjXE.jpg', u'vote_count': 12, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 33667, u'original_language': u'en'}
