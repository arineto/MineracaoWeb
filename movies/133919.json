{u'poster_path': u'/nr87dK7xn8qeJiwYoL2DVJ9WhTm.jpg', u'title': u'Scenes from a Marriage', u'overview': u"Ten years of Marianne and Johan's relationship are presented. We first meet them ten years into their marriage. He is a college professor, she a divorce lawyer. They say that they are happily married - unlike their friends Katarina and Peter who openly fight, especially when under the influence of alcohol - but there is a certain detached aloofness in the way they treat each other. In the next ten years, as they contemplate or embark upon divorce and/or known extramarital affairs, they come to differing understandings at each phase of their relationship of what they truly mean to each other. Regardless of if it's love or hate - between which there is a fine line - they also come to certain understandings of how they can best relate to each other, whether that be as husband and wife, friends, lovers or none of the above.", u'release_date': u'1973-04-11', u'popularity': 0.375536, u'original_title': u'Scener ur ett \xe4ktenskap', u'backdrop_path': u'/iMlRvxKRz8OpePpAEKAXLsGmY3R.jpg', u'vote_count': 14, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 8.1, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 133919, u'original_language': u'en'}
