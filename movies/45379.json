Chang Chen (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) plays the Emperor, who, desperate for the free-spirited life of a wanderer, tries to escape from the royal palace with his sister, the Princess (Faye Wong). He's caught and returned to his angry mother by the royal guards, but the Princess, disguised as a man, manages to escape. Meanwhile, King Bully (Tony Leung) has returned to his hometown, where he is widely despised for his bullying ways, to run a restaurant with his tomboy sister, Phoenix (Vicki Zhao). They have a very close relationship. In fact, King Bully mistakenly believes that he can read his sister's mind. When the Princess arrives in town, King Bully finds himself drawn to her, but, believing she's a man, decides that his attraction is some kind of empathy with Phoenix.", u'release_date': u'2002-02-06', u'popularity': 0.142723, u'original_title': u'Tian xia wu shuang', u'backdrop_path': u'/ZG6XwIY4tefZSZa75wef4IQaL7.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, u'genre_ids': [28, 35, 10749], u'id': 45379, u'original_language': u'en'}
