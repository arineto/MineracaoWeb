{u'poster_path': u'/nT0mdDKWWicVSigXTUV275xaHXE.jpg', u'title': u'The Manchurian Candidate', u'overview': u"When his army unit was ambushed during the first Gulf War, Sergeant Raymond Shaw saved his fellow soldiers just as his commanding officer, then-Captain Ben Marco, was knocked unconscious. Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.", u'release_date': u'2004-07-30', u'popularity': 0.375391, u'original_title': u'The Manchurian Candidate', u'backdrop_path': u'/2EK85HcE4qNdpRHkUWNC1CjNsTW.jpg', u'vote_count': 122, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [18, 9648, 53], u'id': 14462, u'original_language': u'en'}
