Paresh Rawal\u2019s character Kanjilal gets some of the best dialogues and thespian does full justice to them. Kanjilal\u2019s arguments and counter-questions are very well thought out. The take on the God-men is very interesting. The best part was the parallel drawn to the Mahabharata towards the end, with Krishna (Akshay) re-playing his role as the legendary charioteer-advisor for a warrior (Arjun then, Kanji now).', u'release_date': u'2012-09-28', u'popularity': 0.227125, u'original_title': u'OMG: Oh My God!', u'backdrop_path': u'/wjIkB9Ciyq0A4aIbNoFY5vpnuEB.jpg', u'vote_count': 17, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 14], u'id': 135718, u'original_language': u'hi'}
