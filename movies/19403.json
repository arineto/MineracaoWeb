It's made him very rich, but as he hits middle age, he's so depressed and lonely that he takes on one of his victim's sons, Steve McKenna, as his apprentice. Arthur puts him through a rigorous training period and brings him on several hits. As Steven improves, Arthur worries that he'll discover who killed his father.", u'release_date': u'1972-11-17', u'popularity': 0.23006, u'original_title': u'The Mechanic', u'backdrop_path': u'/lWEHUyJgL9LrSUoUipm3nbdEbMd.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 9648, 53], u'id': 19403, u'original_language': u'en'}
