The film distributors were also afraid that the audience would react negatively, so the film had a sneak premiere in Pittsburgh in November 1967 and its official premiere in New York in March 1968, but it didn't go on general release in the US until November 1968. It wasn't released outside the US until its UK premiere in October 1969, followed by Sweden in May 1970, and Italy, Denmark and France in 1971. They didn't dare show in Germany until 1976. Today its regarded a comedy classic.", u'release_date': u'1967-11-22', u'popularity': 0.409872, u'original_title': u'The Producers', u'backdrop_path': u'/tHwxEgaLN2IkocTnxFAaEMz3S3s.jpg', u'vote_count': 36, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 30197, u'original_language': u'en'}
