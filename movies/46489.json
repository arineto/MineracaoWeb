A small community of gnomes is responsible for making the transition between daylight and night. This is called the magic hour, and is created by the magic silver which only these gnomes possess. When the silver is stolen, the world is transformed into eternal night. Princess Bluerose sets out on a remarkable journey to retrieve the silver and save the world from eternal darkness. Magic Silver is based on the popular Norwegian television series Jul i Bl\xe5fjell (1999) and Jul p\xe5 M\xe5netoppen (2002). They are considered classic Christmas calender series, and already firmly entrenched in an entire generation's old Christmas memories.", u'release_date': u'2009-11-13', u'popularity': 0.130914, u'original_title': u'Julenatt i Bl\xe5fjell', u'backdrop_path': u'/lhz9FdX3pR5DZLnXFxTHAj7Kqux.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.0, u'genre_ids': [12, 14, 10751, 10769], u'id': 46489, u'original_language': u'no'}
