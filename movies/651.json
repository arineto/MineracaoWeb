Though highly skilled and deeply dedicated, they adopt a hilarious, lunatic lifestyle as an antidote to the tragedies of their Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, and in the process infuriate Army bureaucrats. Robert Duvall, Gary Burghoff and Sally Kellerman co-star as a sanctimonious Major, an other-worldly Corporal, and a self-righteous yet lusty nurse.", u'release_date': u'1970-01-25', u'popularity': 0.899956, u'original_title': u'M*A*S*H', u'backdrop_path': u'/8u2L2sHHAQVJ4xksOMzuYvL4SPx.jpg', u'vote_count': 85, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10752], u'id': 651, u'original_language': u'en'}
