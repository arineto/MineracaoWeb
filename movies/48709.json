One night, a homeless man sleeps in the foyer of her apartment house; she gives him a hot meal, then a place on the floor to sleep by her radiator, then she offers herself. She falls in love, giving him new life, clothes, a place to live. When he grouses that he must bar hop while she uses the flat for her work, she finds them a larger flat. He grows restless, seducing a manicurist and pressing her to prostitution. He's arrested for procuring, so Marie must decide what to do; he, too, must face the consequences of his choices.", u'release_date': u'1996-01-31', u'popularity': 0.09832, u'original_title': u'Mon homme', u'backdrop_path': u'/5A6F2ubgujUste4liJb7Z1zZtyd.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749], u'id': 48709, u'original_language': u'en'}
