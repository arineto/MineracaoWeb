I\u2019m not going on unless I have my bandanna!\u201d Apparently, he couldn\u2019t find it after tearing apart the little hovel they gave us backstage. Of course the rest of the band was avoiding any eye contact with Axl, preferring to wander off, out of earshot, to do their grumbling.Finally, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Axl?\u201d He shrugged me off and continued with his insane tirade. He had all of our roadies looking around for people who had scarves or bandannas. I said, \u201cC\u2019mon, Axl, let\u2019s just go on.\u201dHe blurted out, \u201cFuck that. Fuck you.
