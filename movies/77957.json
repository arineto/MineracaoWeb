Ethan, one of the town's residents, is a young father but not much more than a kid himself. He has no choice but to look after his three-year-old son Nate, since mom Cindy is an alcoholic. But one snowy day, Ethan's good intentions are thwarted by a moment of thoughtlessness, resulting in tragedy. A local prosecutor haunted by his past goes after Ethan, and the ensuing confusion and casting of blame begins to tear the town apart.", u'release_date': u'2011-12-30', u'popularity': 1.119866, u'original_title': u'Angels Crest', u'backdrop_path': u'/slww4njNttFw3QsW1LlnnjAtcOh.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 77957, u'original_language': u'en'}
