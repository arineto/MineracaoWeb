In a series of flashbacks filmed almost entirely in creams, whites, and ochers, the clownish and superfluous Romano Patroni leaves his wife's opulent home to visit a spa where he falls in love with a Russian woman whose marriage is a horror. He pursues her into the Russian heartland and returns to Italy resolved to leave his wife and marry his love. His amazed and appreciative Russian listener then narrates a shorter story.", u'release_date': u'1987-01-01', u'popularity': 1.150794, u'original_title': u'Oci ciornie', u'backdrop_path': u'/35e3i97V7gprTcWpQHdAI7LQT6q.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [35, 10749, 18], u'id': 44658, u'original_language': u'en'}
