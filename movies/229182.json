{u'poster_path': u'/jzQuSdbgHQit7Js6j7WQWgGFxkB.jpg', u'title': u'The Harvest', u'overview': u"Maryann (an impressive Natasha Calis) moves in with her grandparents after she's orphaned. Desperately lonely, the preteen sets out to befriend a neighboring deathly ill, bed-ridden boy (Charlie Tahan), despite the outright disapproval of his mother (Samantha Morton). Maryann's persistence pays off, however, and during a series of secret visits she gradually uncovers some seriously sinister goings-on in the house... Morton as the boy's overprotective surgeon mom is the stuff of great screen villainy-at once utterly monstrous and tragically desperate-so much so that she makes even frequent heavy Michael Shannon, as the more subdued dad, pale in comparison.", u'release_date': u'2013-10-19', u'popularity': 1.250397, u'original_title': u'The Harvest', u'backdrop_path': u'/VlNJZXBn3SDyTSH4JVJ7eC0lR3.jpg', u'vote_count': 17, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [27, 53], u'id': 229182, u'original_language': u'en'}
