Another laureate is Dr. Max Stratman, the famous German-American physicist who comes to Stockholm with his young and beautiful niece Emily. The Foreign Department also gives him an assistant during his stay, Miss Andersson. Craig soon notices that Dr. Stratman is acting strangely. The second time they meet, Dr. Stratman does not even recognize him.", u'release_date': u'1963-12-25', u'popularity': 0.127864, u'original_title': u'The Prize', u'backdrop_path': u'/riiFCAWSJ8NzKWxxtbdx9AaUhie.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.7, u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 9648], u'id': 4025, u'original_language': u'en'}
