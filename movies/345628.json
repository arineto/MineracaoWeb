{u'poster_path': u'/nVoHGy1daMsPeN1dP8OXLsGAWy2.jpg', u'title': u'Taxi', u'overview': u"Hamburg, mid 80s, Alex is a cabby. The sound is hard, pubs are dark and loud, people constantly argue about anything and everything, people smoke all the time, and not just cigarettes. Alex wants love and freedom and sleeps with Dietrich. It's far from being love, but the sex is okay. With Marc, a little person full of dignity, she finds more than that. The rest is struggles with her passengers, the indifferent and the doomed, brutes as other nuisances. This sort of life could go on and on, Alex could drive away from her own life and in doing so lose Marc and not getting rid of Dietrich. Wouldn't there be a small monkey with the same invincible desire for freedom as hers.", u'release_date': u'2015-08-20', u'popularity': 1.096958, u'original_title': u'Taxi', u'backdrop_path': u'/pM9l9J8kyOf87GvizT8LEgnxBua.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.0, u'genre_ids': [10749, 35, 18], u'id': 345628, u'original_language': u'de'}
