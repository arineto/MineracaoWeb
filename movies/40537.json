Is it a plot by the government to suppress the opposition, or have our terrorist enemies secretly gained control of our security system and are now using it against us? Following another major terrorist attack the US instigates an intense government surveillance program in which every camera in the country is linked into a single, all-seeing network called the ODIN system (for Optical Defense Intelligence Network). The system includes millions of mobile, robotic surveillance cameras known as "Eyeborgs," which watch everyone for suspicious behavior, all in the name of security, law enforcement and keeping America safe. An agent for the Department of Homeland Security grows suspicious of the system after a series of odd murders in which the physical evidence doesn\'t match up to what the video records show. Now he must work outside the system to find out who is really controlling the Eyeborgs.', u'release_date': u'2009-04-29', u'popularity': 1.122875, u'original_title': u'Eyeborgs', u'backdrop_path': u'/r0a0bVGrtVLCvmoW9NJfCaAbrz1.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.4, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 878, 53], u'id': 40537, u'original_language': u'en'}
