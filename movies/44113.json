One such case is that of Gerald "Stone" Creeson (Edward Norton), a convicted arsonist who is up for parole.

Seeing little hope in convincing Jack himself, Stone arranges for his wife Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) to seduce the officer, but motives and intentions steadily blur amidst the passions and buried secrets of the corrupted players in this deadly game of deception.', u'release_date': u'2010-10-08', u'popularity': 1.626317, u'original_title': u'Stone', u'backdrop_path': u'/4aL29QaCEkYDxeiRX8VKKEVL9tM.jpg', u'vote_count': 61, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.8, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 44113, u'original_language': u'en'}
