Seven-year-old Billy Rohan (Sebastian Rice Edwards) finds his childhood to be atime of great dangerand even greater discovery. From thunderous bombings at his own doorstep andthe constant threat of Luftwaffe air raids to the landing of a German paratrooper in his neighborhood and the joyous obliteration of his much-hated school, Billy's young life is shapedand even enrichedby the one positive thing war has brought him: liberation from the ordinary. And though Billy is surrounded by decimation and the smoking remnants of ruined lives, his sense of enchanted wonderment and innocence in the face of man's most destructive folly affect him in a way that alters his life forever.", u'release_date': u'1987-11-01', u'popularity': 1.147197, u'original_title': u'Hope and Glory', u'backdrop_path': u'/vMtXMSanAEICoRr0OA64bBubJWo.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, u'genre_ids': [18, 10752], u'id': 32054, u'original_language': u'en'}
