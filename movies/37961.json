This routine changes one day when he is paid a visit by a man in a trench-coat. Once the two get talking, it seems that the visitor (Calling himself Endou) is a debt collector. The reason for his visit is an unpaid loan which kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate (Furuhata Takeshi). The original loan was 30000 yen and once Takeshi had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji. Kaiji is then told of a way to clear the interest compounded debt (which stood at 3,850,000 yen), which involved getting on a boat with others in his position. Once on the boat the debtors would then have to gamble with loaned money, which would end with a few winning, and others getting into deeper debt and having to work to pay of their debts. After some coercing kaiji accepts a position on the boat, in order to clear himself and make a bit of money as well...', u'release_date': u'2009-10-10', u'popularity': 0.281425, u'original_title': u'\u30ab\u30a4\u30b8 \u4eba\u751f\u9006\u8ee2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0', u'backdrop_path': u'/n1Bz2v19F0s7UTeuqPvvPGKGoDY.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.9, u'genre_ids': [18, 53], u'id': 37961, u'original_language': u'ja'}
