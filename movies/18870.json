For generations the village youths are stolen from their families and delivered as sacrifice to a mythical beast - the Minotaur, that dwells beneath a great palace. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love in an earlier sacrifice is convinced that the beast isn't real and that his girl still lives as a slave within the palace. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage. He devises a plan and is taken with the other youths who are dragged screaming from their families.", u'release_date': u'2006-03-11', u'popularity': 1.177087, u'original_title': u'Minotaur', u'backdrop_path': u'/jigcUloRU17rmskjyVq3G1drKsB.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.1, u'genre_ids': [27, 12, 14], u'id': 18870, u'original_language': u'en'}
