The shy Elizabeth is overwhelmed by Brazilian sensuality. She is the antithesis to Mary\u2019s dashing partner, architect Lota de Macedo Soares. Although frosty at first, the architect soon makes a play for Elizabeth and the poet finally succumbs to Lota\u2019s advances. Mary is jealous, but unconventional Lota is determined to have both women at all costs. Their m\xe9nage \xe0 trois is thrown off balance when Lota starts work on her biggest project to date, designing Parque do Flamengo in Rio. Elizabeth accepts an academic teaching post in the USA and the women drift apart. Lota, at all other times brimming with self-confidence, is inconsolable. This eternal triangle plays out against the backdrop of the military coup of 1964. Bishop\u2019s moving poems are at the core of a film which lushly illustrates a crucial phase in the life of this influential Pulitzer prize-winning poet', u'release_date': u'2013-08-08', u'popularity': 1.215931, u'original_title': u'Flores Raras', u'backdrop_path': u'/amR0RdOazUDEHTkHDNNw2yTkCxl.jpg', u'vote_count': 18, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [10749, 18], u'id': 167683, u'original_language': u'pt'}
