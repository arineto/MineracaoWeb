Beaulieu is a righteous psychopath and fanatic chess player who wants to rid the world of evil. And even though Ian has done nothing wrong, he is beaten, tortured and tormented before Beaulieu makes him an offer: win at chess and he is free to go. And so Ian is now a pawn in Beaulieu 's game. A game in which he will either lose his mind or his life.", u'release_date': u'2009-10-09', u'popularity': 0.185293, u'original_title': u'5150 Rue des Ormes', u'backdrop_path': u'/nYUtd9XiZEuKfT9Mz9tnbC0EF9V.jpg', u'vote_count': 8, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.7, u'genre_ids': [], u'id': 38988, u'original_language': u'fr'}
