All were happy for the couple except one, Set, a jealous man who killed Osiris in order to take over his kingdom. Isis snuck into Osiris' tomb and tried to raise him from the dead using her black magic.

Isis vowed to avenge Osiris' death and return with him to rule over all the worlds. Now, six college students take their last course in archeology in anticipation for graduation. Their last assignment is to uncover and document the museum's new acquisitions with their teacher, Prof. Shields and world-renowned Egyptologist Dr. Nasir. During the night they haphazardly awaken the ancient spirit of Isis' lost soul and her wrath is unleashed on the group.", u'release_date': u'2013-01-17', u'popularity': 1.250225, u'original_title': u'Isis Rising: Curse of the Lady Mummy', u'backdrop_path': u'/12Mfl5AS3apTycp3kUmEbMlGLBE.jpg', u'vote_count': 2, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, u'genre_ids': [27], u'id': 214493, u'original_language': u'en'}
