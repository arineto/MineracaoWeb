From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.", u'release_date': u'2002-09-09', u'popularity': 1.201092, u'original_title': u'Whale Rider', u'backdrop_path': u'/gk0gnxKDrRGa1J8cN6bYz1aHLW6.jpg', u'vote_count': 34, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [18, 10751], u'id': 1088, u'original_language': u'en'}
