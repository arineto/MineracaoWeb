Most students goof off: drinking, partying, and focusing on sex. Eun-shik, a law student who's been in the military, is older but socially inept. He likes Eun-hyo; even though his earnest and simple side appeals to her, his juvenile excesses make him irrelevant when Sung-ok, a good-looking rich kid, charms Eun-hyo. They begin an affair, leaving Eun-shik on the sidelines. The national competition approaches and complications arise.", u'release_date': u'2002-12-13', u'popularity': 1.457175, u'original_title': u'\uc0c9\uc989\uc2dc\uacf5', u'backdrop_path': u'/eJR2AdH8ZV6qRWM4vfzzZyXl68C.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.3, u'genre_ids': [35, 18], u'id': 16318, u'original_language': u'en'}
