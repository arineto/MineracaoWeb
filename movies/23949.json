After 10 years apart, three disparate people come together to play out the unresolved drama of their final days in high school. Intrigued, we watch as layers of denial are slowly peeled away. Suspense builds as each character is provoked into revealing his or her true nature and motivation. Mesmerized, we are drawn into their lives as they choose which cards to play and which cards to hold.', u'release_date': u'2001-01-26', u'popularity': 1.219661, u'original_title': u'Tape', u'backdrop_path': u'/xbW1nnvCCs7eSjf9fTeB4sjbHU9.jpg', u'vote_count': 19, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 23949, u'original_language': u'en'}
