A revolver-wielding stranger, a lone gunman, burdened with emotional scars and blessed with incredible skill, drifts into town and crosses paths with two warring clans who are both on the hunt for a hidden treasure in a remote western town. Knowing his services are valuable to either side, he offers himself to the clan who will offer up the largest share of the wealth.  Yoshitsune commands his Genji gang in white while Kiyomori leads his Heike gang in red. Expectations collide as the key players wonder which gang the gunman will join. Dirty tricks, betrayal, desire and finally, love, get jumbled together, as the situation erupts into a showdown.', u'release_date': u'2007-09-15', u'popularity': 0.178507, u'original_title': u'Sukiyaki Western Django', u'backdrop_path': u'/33fU2GlopMnRd2b1T7Yxqtp31Ul.jpg', u'vote_count': 21, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 35, 53, 37], u'id': 13637, u'original_language': u'en'}
