{u'poster_path': u'/jEjCPXsYjUjJiyVg3ShFEJLsgi8.jpg', u'title': u'Burton and Taylor', u'overview': u"TV drama based on Richard Burton's diaries, about his last performance in 1983 with ex-wife Elizabeth Taylor. They meet after several years and he agrees to her suggestion that they star in a stage revival on Broadway of Noel Coward's comedy 'Private Lives', although Elizabeth Taylor has never before performed on stage. Burton soon regrets his agreement, however, when her pill-popping and lack of discipline causes problems already during the rehearsals. The play opens to a critical trashing, but is popular with audiences because they just want to see Taylor.  After a two month troubled run, the curtain comes down and Taylor tells Burton she has always loved him and still does.  A year later he is dead.", u'release_date': u'2013-07-22', u'popularity': 1.383193, u'original_title': u'Burton and Taylor', u'backdrop_path': u'/xUGYmvk166sChricdv1BQ8ptlEb.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 209091, u'original_language': u'en'}
