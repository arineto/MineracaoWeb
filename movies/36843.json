{u'poster_path': u'/l7H4CZmv1h4pUWBy0OD06oWx2aQ.jpg', u'title': u'Life is Sweet', u'overview': u"Just north of London live Wendy, Andy, and their twenty-something twins, Natalie and Nicola. Wendy clerks in a shop, leads aerobics at a primary school, jokes like a vaudevillian, agrees to waitress at a friend's new restaurant and dotes on Andy, a cook who forever puts off home remodeling projects, and with a drunken friend, buys a broken down lunch wagon. Natalie, with short neat hair and a snappy, droll manner, is a plumber; she has a holiday planned in America, but little else. Last is Nicola, odd man out: a snarl, big glasses, cigarette, mussed hair, jittery fingers, bulimic, jobless, and unhappy. How they interact and play out family conflict and love is the film's subject.", u'release_date': u'1990-11-15', u'popularity': 1.115932, u'original_title': u'Life is Sweet', u'backdrop_path': u'/lQ4Mct3aybJFxRAtHc4mn3dRq7M.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.0, u'genre_ids': [35, 18], u'id': 36843, u'original_language': u'en'}
