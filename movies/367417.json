The hostess continues to wait fully aware he won\u2019t come. Then a man calls out to her\u2026. \u201cThe Dork, The Girl, and The Douchebag,\u201d the latest film in three years by OKUDA Yosuke who made his commercial film debut with \u201cTokyo Playboy Club\u201d (11), is a powerful ensemble drama intertwining a drug dealer, a yakuza, an ex-convict youth, and others. It can be said the film inherits the setting of his previous work, but the intense realism exhibited in the raw chaos far exceeds the previous film and amply points to OKUDA\u2019s future potential. Portraying the complex male character who only lives for violence, OKUDA\u2019s talents as an actor should also not be overlooked.', u'release_date': u'2015-11-22', u'popularity': 1.359755, u'original_title': u'\u30af\u30ba\u3068\u30d6\u30b9\u3068\u30b2\u30b9', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [], u'id': 367417, u'original_language': u'ja'}
