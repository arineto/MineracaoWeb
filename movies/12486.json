Carl and Jimmy, best friends, walk 70 miles to the mating grounds where the female penguins wait. The huddled masses of females - especially Melissa and Vicki - talk about males, mating, and what might happen this year. Carl, Jimmy, and the other males make the long trek talking about food, fornication and flatulence. Until this year, Carl\'s sex life has been dismal, but he falls hard for Melissa. She seems to like him. A crisis develops when Jimmy comes upon something soft in the dark. Can friends forgive? Does parenthood await Carl and Melissa?', u'release_date': u'2007-01-30', u'popularity': 0.20838, u'original_title': u'Farce of the Penguins', u'backdrop_path': u'/ojO03ooK4RDlwchBkfZX5BBEMeP.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 3.7, u'genre_ids': [35, 99], u'id': 12486, u'original_language': u'en'}
