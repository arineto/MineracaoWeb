Z (Yves Montand), a leftist rabble rouser, is killed in what appears to be a traffic accident. But given the political climate, the death of such a prominent activist raises troubling questions.

As the facts leak out, those who tell the truth pay the price for their honesty.", u'release_date': u'1969-02-26', u'popularity': 1.208018, u'original_title': u'Z', u'backdrop_path': u'/nO3PU0YgLk9UIGVfPuIo1QVgQtE.jpg', u'vote_count': 15, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [18, 53, 10769], u'id': 2721, u'original_language': u'fr'}
