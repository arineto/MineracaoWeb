She has fainting fits. Her husband Raoul seeks to save her by enlisting Stephane, a stranger, to be her lover. Although he listens to Mozart and has every Pocket Book arranged in alphabetical order, Stephane fails to cheer Solange. She knits. She does housework. Everyone, including their neighbor a vegetable vendor, agrees that she needs a child, yet she fails to get pregnant by either lover. The three take a job running a kids' summer camp where they meet Christian, the precocious 13-year-old son of the local factory manager. It is Christian who restores Solange to laughter", u'release_date': u'1978-01-11', u'popularity': 1.203276, u'original_title': u'Pr\xe9parez vos mouchoirs', u'backdrop_path': u'/qonaUlWkq652PQNa8In3ZcUl9l3.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [10749, 35, 18], u'id': 4267, u'original_language': u'fr'}
