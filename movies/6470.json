Multiple attempts to assault the cartel's mountainous compound have been thwarted by a Scorpion-attack helicopter piloted by a cartel leader, Eric Stoller (Bert Rhine). After having several aircraft shot down, most notably a pair of UH\u201360 Black Hawks and their AH\u20131 Cobra escorts, the army turns to the new AH\u201364 Apache attack helicopter, which can match its enemies' maneuverability and firepower.", u'release_date': u'1990-05-25', u'popularity': 1.09835, u'original_title': u'Fire Birds', u'backdrop_path': u'/gfRsntRo6ajrRwvwB8ENXK9lo7e.jpg', u'vote_count': 9, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 3.9, u'genre_ids': [28, 12], u'id': 6470, u'original_language': u'en'}
