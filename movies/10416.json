The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?", u'release_date': u'2000-03-03', u'popularity': 1.27385, u'original_title': u'What Planet Are You From?', u'backdrop_path': u'/xTTgS9XmuunlKhKqYIx8KoRp2I6.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.4, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749, 878], u'id': 10416, u'original_language': u'en'}
