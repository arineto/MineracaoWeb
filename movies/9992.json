Arthur discovers that the key to success lies in his own descent into the land of the Minimoys, creatures no larger than a tooth, whom his grandfather helped relocate to their garden. Somewhere among them is hidden a pile of rubies, too. Can Arthur be of stout heart and save the day? Romance beckons as well, and a villain lurks.", u'release_date': u'2006-12-13', u'popularity': 1.703584, u'original_title': u'Arthur et les Minimoys', u'backdrop_path': u'/3zpcmA6Lcv2K7kxGV5hQfegQd7Y.jpg', u'vote_count': 158, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.7, u'genre_ids': [12, 14, 16, 10751], u'id': 9992, u'original_language': u'fr'}
