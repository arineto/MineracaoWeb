Beneath its charming cobblestone streets dwell the Boxtrolls, foul monsters who crawl out of the sewers at night and steal what the townspeople hold most dear: their children and their cheeses.

In truth, the Boxtrolls are an underground cavern-dwelling community of quirky and lovable oddballs who wear recycled cardboard boxes the way turtles wear their shells. The Boxtrolls have raised an orphaned human boy since infancy as one of their dumpster-diving and mechanical junk-collecting own. When the Boxtrolls are targeted by a villainous pest exterminator who is bent on eradicating them as his ticket to Cheesebridge society, the kind-hearted band of tinkerers must turn to their adopted charge and an adventurous rich girl to bridge two worlds amidst the winds of change \u2013 and cheese.', u'release_date': u'2014-09-26', u'popularity': 1.264883, u'original_title': u'The Boxtrolls', u'backdrop_path': u'/yFtr1BD7AHeruIm9jsVnoebEN2v.jpg', u'vote_count': 313, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.7, u'genre_ids': [12, 16, 35, 14, 10751], u'id': 170687, u'original_language': u'en'}
