And most importantly\u2026 will Draculaura pass her driving test?', u'release_date': u'2011-12-21', u'popularity': 1.352077, u'original_title': u'Monster High: Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?', u'backdrop_path': u'/bxCIJT0ExYrQOp3UHV48j8Erq3t.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.0, u'genre_ids': [14, 16], u'id': 167313, u'original_language': u'en'}
