{u'poster_path': u'/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg', u'title': u'Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation', u'overview': u"James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara star as Roger and Peggy Hobbs, a St. Louis couple with a large brood who desire a seaside vacation. Renting a cottage by the ocean is just the first step in a summer fraught with disasters, including a couch potato son, a shy daughter with newly installed braces, a pair of grown daughters who have married badly, and a local yachtsman with eyes for Peggy. Not to mention the ramshackle state of the shoreline abode, Roger and Peggy's new grandparent status, and incidents involving a sexy neighbor, a sailboat regatta and bird watching. ~ Karl Williams, All Movie Guide", u'release_date': u'1962-06-15', u'popularity': 1.178884, u'original_title': u'Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation', u'backdrop_path': u'/jaXaFgiFtwRXFbf42Ti94hACesJ.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.3, u'genre_ids': [35, 10751], u'id': 41521, u'original_language': u'en'}
