Howard fantasy story of the sword and sorcery hero, Conan the Barbarian. The story begins when a horde of rampaging warriors massacre the parents of young Conan and enslave the young child for years on The Wheel of Pain. As the sole survivor of the childhood massacre, Conan is released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness to seek vengeance on Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the man responsible for killing his family. In the wilderness, Conan takes up with the thieves Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai (Gerry Lopez). The group comes upon King Osric (Max Von Sydow), who wants the trio of warriors to help rescue his daughter who has joined Doom in the hills.", u'release_date': u'1982-05-14', u'popularity': 1.392937, u'original_title': u'Conan the Barbarian', u'backdrop_path': u'/nvMjK1uiIN5PDHwA6BF7ij8SUFB.jpg', u'vote_count': 243, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 14], u'id': 9387, u'original_language': u'en'}
