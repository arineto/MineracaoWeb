She provokes, drinks, fights and her next tattoo will be a portrait of Adolf Hitler. The only place she feels home is the Neo-Nazi gang she belongs to, where hate, violence, and heavy parties are the daily rules. When 14-year-old Svenja joins the group, Marisa appears like a role model to her: she fits the purest idea of a combat girl fighting for the group's ideology. But Marisa's convictions will slowly evolve when she accidentally meets a young Afghan refugee. Confronted to him, she will learn that the black and white principles of her gang are not the only way. Will Marisa ever be able to get out of this group?", u'release_date': u'2011-06-28', u'popularity': 1.303132, u'original_title': u'Kriegerin', u'backdrop_path': u'/6YkTdgsYoAZHoOvWNtuoqIDs2b9.jpg', u'vote_count': 9, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.7, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 82529, u'original_language': u'de'}
