The answer is this documentary starting out exploring genre-based monster art and then taking an odd turn into the blurring of fantasy and reality. Because halfway through producing this treatise with cinematographer Will Barratt at his L.A. ArieScope Pictures offices, they are contacted by former policeman William Dekker who claims he can prove that monsters are indeed real. That they live in world just below our own named The Marrow and he knows where one of the entrances to this dark hidden universe is. Green of course is intrigued and so the monster hunting expedition begins\u2026 to become something else far more frightening than he ever imagined.', u'release_date': u'2015-02-20', u'popularity': 0.111264, u'original_title': u'Digging Up the Marrow', u'backdrop_path': u'/cY2HaFtp0zbrG0d0srtGk0nEvQF.jpg', u'vote_count': 22, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.4, u'genre_ids': [14, 27, 9648, 53], u'id': 279972, u'original_language': u'en'}
