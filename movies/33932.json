When one of his friends Julius Jenson sells his novel for US$ 190,000.00 to an editor, Jabez fells envy and promises to sell his soul to the devil for success and accidentally kills a woman with his typing machine. The Devil knocks on his door, fixes the situation and seals a contract with Jabez. His low quality novels have bad reviews but become best-sellers; Jabez enriches; has success with women, but has no time for his friends. Jabez meets with the publisher Daniel Webster who offers him a chance to break the contract with the devil.', u'release_date': u'2003-02-19', u'popularity': 1.150367, u'original_title': u'Shortcut to Happiness', u'backdrop_path': u'/vjCo6d9ZfUR0aHYPwzaH8RmCWb9.jpg', u'vote_count': 9, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.0, u'genre_ids': [14, 18, 35, 878], u'id': 33932, u'original_language': u'en'}
