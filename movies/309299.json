{u'poster_path': u'/gyFMUvk7gDMYQa988CaYz65COks.jpg', u'title': u'Experimenter', u'overview': u'Yale University, 1961. Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think they\u2019re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects don\u2019t stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because they\u2019ve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmann\u2019s trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into people\u2019s tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha stands by him through it all.', u'release_date': u'2015-10-16', u'popularity': 1.45237, u'original_title': u'Experimenter', u'backdrop_path': u'/tsIS04uatNu1QEhTiVewg4HrrTd.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [36, 18], u'id': 309299, u'original_language': u'en'}
