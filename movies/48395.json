But this particular Santa isn\'t the one you want coming to town. When all the local children begin mysteriously disappearing, young Pietari and his father Rauno, a reindeer hunter by trade, capture the mythological being and attempt to sell Santa to the misguided leader of the multinational corporation sponsoring the dig. Santa\'s elves, however, will stop at nothing to free their fearless leader from captivity. What ensues is a wildly humorous nightmare - a fantastically bizarre polemic on modern day morality. RARE EXPORTS: A CHRISTMAS TALE is a re-imagining of the most classic of all childhood fantasies, and is a darkly comic gem soon to be required perennial holiday viewing.', u'release_date': u'2010-12-03', u'popularity': 0.356761, u'original_title': u'Rare Exports', u'backdrop_path': u'/fDYF8Mt5JeZPzIhlZedA6LWuJFc.jpg', u'vote_count': 42, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [28, 14, 878], u'id': 48395, u'original_language': u'en'}
