He's not altogether bitter, but not happy either, as everything his wife does annoys him, and he disapproves of the man his daughter is about to marry. When his wife suddenly dies, he sets out to postpone the imminent marriage of his daughter to a man he doesn't like, while coping with discoveries about his late wife and himself in the process.", u'release_date': u'2002-12-13', u'popularity': 1.843726, u'original_title': u'About Schmidt', u'backdrop_path': u'/e24dN60wkwD6wt2i9FN2QOJWJV3.jpg', u'vote_count': 101, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [18, 35], u'id': 2755, u'original_language': u'en'}
