The only reason she lives in a care home is because of her husband Max's illness: a series of strokes has reduced him to a vegetable. The fact that Lily isn\u2019t exactly the way she used to be becomes slowly clear in the Danish drama Key House Mirror - the title refers to a memory test.  It\u2019s not easy for Lily to leave her old habits behind her and fit in with the rules of the home. Her life blossoms when she meets an 80-year-old Swedish neighbour, a charming man who gives her the attention she has long missed. Lily\u2019s daughter, however, is not so happy with the budding romance.", u'release_date': u'2015-11-12', u'popularity': 1.291637, u'original_title': u'N\xf8gle hus spejl', u'backdrop_path': u'/q3xHQshpnAkl0U6fq89bUbOkeSF.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [10749, 18, 10751], u'id': 318043, u'original_language': u'en'}
