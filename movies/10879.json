He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.", u'release_date': u'1994-06-29', u'popularity': 0.236236, u'original_title': u'I Love Trouble', u'backdrop_path': u'/4iosJnVbfTVGZ59hxSnzJjCEygp.jpg', u'vote_count': 13, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [28, 35, 10749], u'id': 10879, u'original_language': u'en'}
