No camping, no white-water rafting, no vacation at all. So it doesn't surprise anyone that the young witch is quite disgruntled when arriving at Altenberg Castle. Her roommate is a touchy unpleassant fashion victim and headmaster Quirin Bartels is so muddle-headed that he can't even remember the names of his students properly. But then Bibi makes friends with Elea, a girl wheelchair-bound since a terrible accident where she also lost her beloved parents. Now Bibi is determined to help the sensitive Elea, searching a way to heal her from her palsy legs.", u'release_date': u'2004-09-29', u'popularity': 1.111177, u'original_title': u'Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen', u'backdrop_path': u'/eJTtPYxcBssoC015Qn86klgf2Nh.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.7, u'genre_ids': [10751, 35], u'id': 40975, u'original_language': u'de'}
