While her husband Jake (Chris Potter) suggests an intimate dinner at a fancy restaurant in their hometown of Middleton, Cassie would rather have a party at The Grey House, with all her loved ones in attendance. And since Jake's kids, Brandon (Matthew Knight) and Lori (Hannah Endicott-Douglas), are growing up with lives of their own, it might be their last chance to unite as a family for a long time.  As Cassie's special day is fast approaching, Lori discovers disturbing parallels between Cassie and Cassie's great aunt, nicknamed the Grey Lady, who disappeared at her own birthday party years before. With signs of a curse looming over her, it's clear that Cassie needs to conjure up more than a little magic to make things right again. Is there birthday magic in the air or is it a birthday curse?", u'release_date': u'2013-10-26', u'popularity': 0.140402, u'original_title': u"The Good Witch's Destiny", u'backdrop_path': u'/ldIib8JvdeD86si2ImZFNf7hPRk.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 14, 10751], u'id': 230407, u'original_language': u'en'}
