Their goal of destroying the Dwarvish House of Durin is redirected, however, toward the conquest of Erebor and the destruction of man, dwarves and Elves, culminating into an epic battle to rule Middle Earth.  ~~~~~ [NOTE: This is not the Hobbit movie, it is an alternate Orc movie - a companion to "The Dwarves of Erebor" version; Azog the Defiler is protagonist and Gandalf is antagonist here; Bilbo and Dwarves are supporting characters. This is the entire trilogy cut into an "Orc assault" movie. We follow only Azog and Orcs and Gandalf through this story. The Erebor quest, though mentioned, is not generally a part of this alternate story.]', u'release_date': u'2015-05-01', u'popularity': 0.192033, u'original_title': u'The Hobbit: The Orc of Gundabad', u'backdrop_path': u'/fIJasheRi78bdW7B3MoZewIDSQR.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [14], u'id': 341666, u'original_language': u'en'}
