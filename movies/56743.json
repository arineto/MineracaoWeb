The friendship between Peyton, an out lesbian writer, and Elena, the wife of an anti-gay paster who has never experienced true love, transforms swiftly from a one-sided crush into a torrid extramarital affair. Despite their attraction, Peyton, jaded in a number of ways, has strong reservations about becoming involved with a married straight woman; Elena, recognizing that she is caught in a loveless marriage, can barely begin to rationalize the nature and magnitude of her desires.  As their relationship evolves, Elena confronts the choice of leaving her husband or  ending her involvement with Peyton to save her unraveling and unrewarding marriage and return to a drab and automated life. Above all, Elena faces the looming challenge of convincing Peyton that the two women have a bright future together despite their unfavorable circumstances', u'release_date': u'2010-06-25', u'popularity': 1.114608, u'original_title': u'Elena Undone', u'backdrop_path': u'/oMMIqIju5ivJo9nCzlrRYLqmb02.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.1, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 56743, u'original_language': u'en'}
