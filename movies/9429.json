They exist only to hit on women at discos, though they're routinely unsuccessful until a chance run-in with Richard Grieco gets them inside the swank Roxbury club. Mistaken for high rollers, they meet their dream women, Vivica and Cambi, and resolve to open a club of their own.", u'release_date': u'1998-10-01', u'popularity': 2.002245, u'original_title': u'A Night at the Roxbury', u'backdrop_path': u'/vE1M9gUbADXRbAZTAFWqAiKAtbL.jpg', u'vote_count': 63, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 9429, u'original_language': u'en'}
