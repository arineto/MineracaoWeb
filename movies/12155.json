At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and surreal place called 'Underland,' she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches. Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.", u'release_date': u'2010-03-04', u'popularity': 3.86416, u'original_title': u'Alice in Wonderland', u'backdrop_path': u'/AmCtBQc5KxJfJVdS2TkY4Pc9lPd.jpg', u'vote_count': 1947, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [10751, 14, 12], u'id': 12155, u'original_language': u'en'}
