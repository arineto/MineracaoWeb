Within a fortnight, two witnesses are dead. Two cops from vice squad, Johansson and Jarnebring, who were the first to the crime scene, pursue all leads and identify a suspect, an arrogant member of the elite secret police, a man assigned to guard the country's Minister of Justice.

Who's protecting the suspect and why?", u'release_date': u'1984-01-01', u'popularity': 0.267657, u'original_title': u'Mannen fr\xe5n Mallorca', u'backdrop_path': u'/daY472O8sPNRWjku78Uca7sgY7Z.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [80], u'id': 52331, u'original_language': u'sv'}
