{u'poster_path': u'/8kopiojZ7neDOHD9OzwDGp3GTyp.jpg', u'title': u'Lemon Tree Passage', u'overview': u"An Australian urban legend comes screaming on the Ozploitation scene. It\u2019s said that if you drive down the creepy road of Lemon Tree Passage, and witness a sudden flash of light in the trees, you'll be forever haunted by the tormented spirit of a man killed by thrill speeding teenagers. Wanting to put this old wives\u2019 tale to the test, a car-load of non-believers take the supposedly cursed journey and do indeed see a strange manifestation. But it\u2019s not the one of popular myth - this sudden possession of one of their number involves another altogether more shocking crime. That of a young girl raped and murdered on the same stretch of highway. As one urban legend trumps another, the scared passengers must sort out the facts of both cases before vengeful justice from beyond the grave can be meted out with moody atmosphere, ghostly thrills and supernatural suspense.", u'release_date': u'2014-08-25', u'popularity': 1.397676, u'original_title': u'Lemon Tree Passage', u'backdrop_path': u'/e9apNTJqYec03PeefeEOu0nB8tn.jpg', u'vote_count': 11, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.9, u'genre_ids': [53, 27, 9648], u'id': 280000, u'original_language': u'en'}
