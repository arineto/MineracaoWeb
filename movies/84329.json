Initially resistant to the idea, Frank soon appreciates the benefits of robotic support \u2013 like nutritious meals and a clean house \u2013 and eventually begins to treat his robot like a true companion. With his robot\u2019s assistance, Frank\u2019s passion for his old, unlawful profession is reignited, for better or worse.', u'release_date': u'2012-08-16', u'popularity': 0.537413, u'original_title': u'Robot & Frank', u'backdrop_path': u'/vWrWTEXfkF3r1sIgZlORVN7UPVr.jpg', u'vote_count': 194, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.6, u'genre_ids': [35, 80, 18, 878], u'id': 84329, u'original_language': u'en'}
