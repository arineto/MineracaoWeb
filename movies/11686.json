Allen's cowardice serves him well when he hides in a cannon and is shot into a tent of French soldiers, making him a national hero. A hilarious parody of Russian literature, Love and Death is a must-see for fans of Allen's films.", u'release_date': u'1975-06-10', u'popularity': 0.413935, u'original_title': u'Love and Death', u'backdrop_path': u'/egn370DYBLgGWA0FJh7Fe5nKRlK.jpg', u'vote_count': 31, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [35, 36], u'id': 11686, u'original_language': u'en'}
