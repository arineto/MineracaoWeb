They frustratingly watch on as their peers find love and companionship, while they continue to fail in spectacular fashion when it comes to romance. As they reach their loneliness breaking point they make a pact to forgo their familiar, vanilla personas in exchange for their unexplored, confident alter egos. They wave goodbye to Jeff\u2019s awkward all-male book club and Anne\u2019s flailing attempts to catch the eye of Jeff\u2019s sexy neighbor Max, and say hello to raucous summer nights filled with booze, dancing, and sex.
