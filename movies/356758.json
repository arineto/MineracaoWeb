Martina had left Chile and moved to Italy when she met Marco. Their relationship has run its course, however, and Martina longs to go back to her country with Mateo, but Marco, the loving father left out of the equation, is adamantly against the idea. The couple clash for weeks on end, until Martina abruptly leaves the country with their son, goes back to Chile and virtually vanishes. With no news of Mateo, time seems to stand still for Marco. Anguished and unable to cope, he finally rallies and sets off in search of his son.', u'release_date': u'2015-09-24', u'popularity': 0.110668, u'original_title': u'La prima luce', u'backdrop_path': u'/v4BXp67DdO0gOCKuplUqTAJgaYW.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.5, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 356758, u'original_language': u'it'}
