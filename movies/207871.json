{u'poster_path': u'/uzRvPSqWdMGDeUdIk4bn0RPyQhA.jpg', u'title': u'Savannah', u'overview': u"Savannah is the true story of Ward Allen, a romantic and bombastic character who rejects his plantation heritage for the freedom of life on a river. Ward navigates the change of early 20th century America on the wrong side of the law and society, his long-time friend, a freed slave named Christmas Moultrie, at his side. Master of Shakespeare, and the shotgun that provides Savannah's markets with fowl, Ward fights for his rights as a hunter. His charisma and eloquent rhetoric win the heart of a society woman who defies her father to marry him. An elderly Moultrie tells the story of life on the river with his friend to a little boy, who passes the legendary Ward Allen down to the next generation.", u'release_date': u'2013-04-25', u'popularity': 1.209635, u'original_title': u'Savannah', u'backdrop_path': u'/drGwqcfJ7YdIyUS8ElePGsTGIyL.jpg', u'vote_count': 2, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [10749, 36, 18, 10751], u'id': 207871, u'original_language': u'en'}
