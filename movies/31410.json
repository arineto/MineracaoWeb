However, the two coworkers become at odds over Ot\xedk's inability to perform even the simplest tasks. P\xe1vek demands that Ot\xedk be transferred to assist another driver, who happens to be a choleric and suspicious man named Turek (Turk in Czech). Rather than work with Turek, Ot\xedk decides to accept an offer of employment in Prague, but finds he does not fit in to the city life.
