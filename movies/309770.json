A young orphan girl, Ayden, receives a magic crystal from a dying elf, with a warning that the North has lost its magic, and that she alone can save Christmas.  Ayden and her orphan friends begin a perilous journey and must escape dragons, goblins, bandits, ogres, and other fantasy creatures as they team up with Airk, the wayward son of Father Christmas, to return a stolen Christmas orb to the North.  When Santa's magic cannot overpower the growing Snarl (an evil forest with tentacle branches), Ayden and Airk must deliver Christmas on a sleigh pulled by a young dragon, fulfilling Christmas wishes for children to restore Santa's magic and save Christmas.", u'release_date': u'2014-11-07', u'popularity': 1.32667, u'original_title': u'The Christmas Dragon', u'backdrop_path': u'/iKpfJBA5srFMeVTqxRGhMepTh74.jpg', u'vote_count': 2, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [10751, 12, 14], u'id': 309770, u'original_language': u'en'}
