He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, "Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, traces Sammy\'s movements and finds an unusual cafe, "The Time of Eve". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe\'s main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids.
