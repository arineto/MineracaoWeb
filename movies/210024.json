Actor William Hartnell felt trapped by a succession of hard-man roles. Wannabe producer Verity Lambert was frustrated by the TV industry's glass ceiling.

Allied with a team of unusual but brilliant people, they went on to create the longest running science fiction series ever made.", u'release_date': u'2013-11-21', u'popularity': 0.124654, u'original_title': u'An Adventure in Space and Time', u'backdrop_path': u'/gUh1Sktn91olROdTTnMYxhqxVo1.jpg', u'vote_count': 27, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.3, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 210024, u'original_language': u'en'}
