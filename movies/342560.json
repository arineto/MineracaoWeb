Aldo pulled out of the bout and a interim championship bout between Chad Mendes and McGregor took place at this event.  The UFC received official medical confirmation from several doctors that Aldo did not have a broken rib as he claimed and the biggest problem was the weight cutting process being complicated by the injury. This was confirmed when a release of an Xray tied to an old injury was released by Aldo's camp.  The co-main event featured a 170 lbs UFC Welterweight Championship bout between current champion Robbie Lawler and top contender Rory MacDonald.  145 lbs: Dennis Bermudez vs. Jeremy Stephens | 170 lbs: Gunnar Nelson vs. Brandon Thatch | 135 lbs.: Thomas Almeida vs. Brad Pickett", u'release_date': u'2015-07-11', u'popularity': 1.172503, u'original_title': u'UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor', u'backdrop_path': u'/iSznQ1jAae59YRGXH12ZWO7VEIE.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [], u'id': 342560, u'original_language': u'en'}
