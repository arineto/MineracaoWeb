Inspector Slack sees Miss Marple as a bit of a busy body and drops the investigation after only a few days. Miss Marple however determines that there is only one spot along the line where a body could have been dumped and it happens to be very near the Crackenthorpe estate. She asks her niece, Lucy Eyelesbarrow, to go there undercover as a domestic. She soon finds the dead woman's body at which time the police take on a renewed interest but it is left to Miss Marple to solve the mystery.", u'release_date': u'1987-02-25', u'popularity': 1.137501, u'original_title': u'4.50 from Paddington', u'backdrop_path': u'/dUW9sRnMLUEjLM5bolYddJZIXz.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 3.3, u'genre_ids': [], u'id': 45342, u'original_language': u'en'}
