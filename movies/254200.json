But all that changes when the two of them are called out to a domestic dispute between a junkie couple, caught in a vicious cycle of violence and drugs. It all looks very routine \u2013 until Andreas finds the couple's infant son, crying in a closet. The usually collected policeman finds himself confronted with his own powerlessness and is shaken to his core. As Andreas slowly loses his grip on justice, it suddenly becomes up to the unruly Simon to restore the balance between right and wrong.", u'release_date': u'2014-09-09', u'popularity': 1.343532, u'original_title': u'En chance til', u'backdrop_path': u'/wCDdX9DVeR5vRxF1NnnDWRAdD8W.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [53, 18], u'id': 254200, u'original_language': u'da'}
