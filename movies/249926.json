Carl is happily married, Sally's engaged - where's the harm? Yet they find themselves increasingly drawn to each other, and as their friendship grows to flirtation they refuse to admit - to each other or themselves - that a line might be crossed. The consequences of discovery will be life-changing, catastrophic perhaps, and yet they can't help falling in love.", u'release_date': u'2014-01-06', u'popularity': 1.120118, u'original_title': u'The 7:39', u'backdrop_path': u'/maqu7IXPQ6FX68cZ7DR7jJAzaZD.jpg', u'vote_count': 9, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [10749, 18], u'id': 249926, u'original_language': u'en'}
