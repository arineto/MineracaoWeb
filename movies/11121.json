A strong-willed peasant girl (Nastassja Kinski, in a gorgeous breakthrough) is sent by her father to the estate of some local aristocrats to capitalize on a rumor that their families are from the same line.  This fateful visit commences an epic narrative of sex, class, betrayal, and revenge, which Polanski unfolds with deliberation and finesse.  With its earthy visual textures, achieved by two world-class cinematographers\u2014Geoffrey Unsworth (Cabaret) and Ghislain Cloquet (Au hasard Balthazar)\u2014Tess is a work of great pastoral beauty as well as vivid storytelling.', u'release_date': u'1979-10-31', u'popularity': 1.409518, u'original_title': u'Tess', u'backdrop_path': u'/fyFRF4bZmidgqFBwfDZVCWKmyCx.jpg', u'vote_count': 20, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 11121, u'original_language': u'en'}
