Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school. The affluent man lives a steady yet boring life. At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in. There live a crowd of lively Spanish maids who will help Jean-Louis to open to a new civilization and a new approach of life. In their company - and more precisely in the company of beautiful Maria - Jean-Louis will gradually become another man, a better man.", u'release_date': u'2010-10-22', u'popularity': 0.269119, u'original_title': u'Les Femmes du 6\xe8me \xe9tage', u'backdrop_path': u'/mmrlAk7BpkJ37PYOUzLvFXpdCWM.jpg', u'vote_count': 28, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.9, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 57243, u'original_language': u'en'}
