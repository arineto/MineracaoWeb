The Honor\xe9 film concerns a series of hopelessly romantic Parisian characters who are unable to convey their feelings to one another in everyday situations, and who thus use musical numbers as outlets -- as vehicles of emotional expression. Beaupain composed the score; a number of the songs that are included appeared on one of his solo albums. The individual stories covered in the film tell age-worn tales as old as time: the loss of love, the discovery of new love, the impossibility of mutual love.", u'release_date': u'2007-05-23', u'popularity': 1.133059, u'original_title': u"Les Chansons d'Amour", u'backdrop_path': u'/2l9YWKlSwz2YgwdHm3NPFVSQzQa.jpg', u'vote_count': 22, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 14448, u'original_language': u'en'}
