{u'poster_path': u'/mUdr5f72PC4GOa9UGVcIdupzbYD.jpg', u'title': u'The Ape Girl', u'overview': u"The story of Ming Ling Shur, a girl who was raised by apes and thus has a natural ability with monkey kung fu. She also resembles a monkey for most of the film (not really explained why). She grows up and falls for a prince who is really an evil kung fu master, who exploits her abilities for his own gain. Now here's why the film works; Kam Fung does an excellent job as the Ape Girl, being very eccentric at times with the actions of a monkey. Also, we see early performances by Lo Lieh as an assassin, and Chen Sing as the prince.", u'release_date': u'1979-01-01', u'popularity': 1.105, u'original_title': u'Zui hou nu', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [28], u'id': 192226, u'original_language': u'en'}
