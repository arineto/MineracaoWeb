When questioned later they themselves seem changed, as they deny everything or make lame excuses. As the invaders increase in number they become more open and Bennell, who has by now witnessed an attempted "replacement", realises that he and his friends must escape or suffer the same fate. But who can he trust to help him and who has already been snatched?', u'release_date': u'1978-12-20', u'popularity': 0.233433, u'original_title': u'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', u'backdrop_path': u'/9RBrNVbgaNDpZdGiU98OzZtY4c2.jpg', u'vote_count': 50, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [27, 9648, 878, 53], u'id': 11850, u'original_language': u'en'}
