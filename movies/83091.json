Injured, the man manages only to say something about Asgard. Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiry\u016b and Shun are wondering about Hy\u014dga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At Valhalla, the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hy\u014dga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiry\u016b, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of Odin. Midgard reveals himself as Hy\u014dga and tries to kill Shiry\u016b to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hy\u014dga.', u'release_date': u'1988-03-12', u'popularity': 1.178653, u'original_title': u'Saint Seiya: Kamigami no atsuki tatakai', u'backdrop_path': u'/ax2ouEMKAHZtAptjloc101H6p9l.jpg', u'vote_count': 5, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [16, 28, 14], u'id': 83091, u'original_language': u'pt'}
