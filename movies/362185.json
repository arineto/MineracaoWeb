Not knowing who or why, the one thing they do know is if they fail to discreetly collaborate with one another - they will be solely responsible for facilitating the biggest crime in the city's history. Now they must race against the clock to make the choice of their lives - save the city - or save their daughter.", u'release_date': u'2015-08-21', u'popularity': 1.569793, u'original_title': u'Operator', u'backdrop_path': u'/4ylskDQhylV5Blg2FgmmZHcPYVx.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.0, u'genre_ids': [53, 28, 18], u'id': 362185, u'original_language': u'en'}
