Kim Darby plays a 1920s-era debutante who is kidnapped and held for ransom. Her captors are the Grissoms, a family comprised of sadists and morons, and headed by Ma Barker clone Irene Dailey. One of the Grissoms, played by Scott Wilson, takes a liking to his prisoner, which results in a bloody breakdown of the family unit. Both The Grissom Gang and the original No Orchids For Miss Blandish were inspired by the best-seller by James Hadley Chase, though neither film retains Chase's original ending.", u'release_date': u'1971-05-28', u'popularity': 1.112893, u'original_title': u'The Grissom Gang', u'backdrop_path': u'/7n5WTJMIL4i1Epbpe46fANg0g4v.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [18, 28, 53, 80], u'id': 79645, u'original_language': u'en'}
