The great device codenamed as the \u201cPhantom\u201d is invented by the Global Security Corporation in order to eliminate the crime and to establish a secure global community.  But, it is not how it really is. The reverse side of the \u201cPhantom\u201d is to establish an absolute control over people\u2019s minds. The Corporation aims to change the course of the history, by gaining the community of obedient \u201cpuppets\u201d, who would never realize that their minds are being controlled.  Step by step, the \u201cPhantom\u201d fractures people\u2019s lives, but nobody suspects anything, until it destroys the lives of in-love couple- Timur and Keira. She is convicted of murder, and he needs to break the law to save her. An American criminal hacker named Zach helps Timur to find the truth, and to uncover the Corporation\u2019s conspiracy.', u'release_date': u'2014-01-30', u'popularity': 0.100359, u'original_title': u'Hunting the Phantom', u'backdrop_path': u'/3RavRhGccCI8aCkYDOpqrs5sr38.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.0, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 878], u'id': 252728, u'original_language': u'ru'}
