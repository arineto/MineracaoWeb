First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.", u'release_date': u'2004-09-14', u'popularity': 0.161535, u'original_title': u'Siblings', u'backdrop_path': u'/ztKo7c645c3sC65vxkdG0FFgljf.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 105299, u'original_language': u'en'}
