Ten years ago, they all acted together in a Cambridge University student comedy troupe, but it's less clear how much they have in common now.Peter's friends are Andrew (Branagh), now a writer in Hollywood; married jingle writers Roger (Laurie) and Mary (Staunton); glamorous costume designer Sarah (Emmanuel); and eccentric Maggie (Thompson), who works in publishing. Cast in sharp relief to the university chums are Carol (Rudner), the American TV star wife of Andrew; and loutish Brian (Slattery), Sarah's very recently acquired lover. Law plays Peter's disapproving housekeeper, Vera; and Lowe, her son Paul. Briers appears in a cameo role as Peter's father.", u'release_date': u'1992-11-13', u'popularity': 1.229745, u'original_title': u"Peter's Friends", u'backdrop_path': u'/jzKm77hlqTQeq7Dl3EgUer6NUet.jpg', u'vote_count': 13, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, u'genre_ids': [35, 18], u'id': 11790, u'original_language': u'en'}
