He's sought as a teacher and vassal by Shogun, Japan's most powerful clan leader. He's also challenged to fight by the supremely confident and skilful Sasaki Kojiro. Takezo agrees to fight Kojiro in a year's time but rejects Shogun's patronage, choosing instead to live on the edge of a village, raising vegetables. He's followed there by Otsu and later by Akemi, both in love with him. The year ends as Takezo assists the villagers against a band of brigands. He seeks Otsu's forgiveness and accepts her love, then sets off across the water to Ganryu Island for his final contest.", u'release_date': u'1956-01-03', u'popularity': 1.107333, u'original_title': u'\u5bae\u672c\u6b66\u8535\u5b8c\u7d50\u7de8\u3000\u6c7a\u95d8\u5dcc\u6d41\u5cf6', u'backdrop_path': u'/2gttdqTLkFO5AUkFafVBWigT2mj.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [28, 12, 18, 10749, 36], u'id': 31378, u'original_language': u'ja'}
