{u'poster_path': u'/iRBM8cuukc67elZW0zX7wCKOwl.jpg', u'title': u'Lucky You', u'overview': u'A professional poker player whose astounding luck at the table fails to translate into his lonesome love life attempts to win the World Series of Poker while simultaneously earning the affections of a beautiful Las Vegas singer in a high-stakes emotional drama from L.A. Confidential director Curtis Hanson and Munich screenwriter Eric Roth. When his personal problems threaten to distract him from what could be his biggest win ever, seasoned poker pro Huck Cheever (Eric Bana) finds comfort in the company of singer Billie Offer (Drew Barrymore). Upon preparing for the biggest card game in the country, however, Huck soon realizes that his problems have only just begun when he finds that his opponent at the table will be none other than his estranged father, L.C. (Robert Duvall), a poker legend whose mythical reputation makes him a more than worthy opponent for his troubled son. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi.', u'release_date': u'2007-05-01', u'popularity': 1.323801, u'original_title': u'Lucky You', u'backdrop_path': u'/mhujGr8wLriDT4VeTjQmBAgcrJQ.jpg', u'vote_count': 23, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.7, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 1950, u'original_language': u'en'}
