Poitras is a great and brave filmmaker, but she is also a masterful storyteller: she compresses the many days of questioning, waiting, confirming, watching the world\u2019s reaction and agonizing over the next move, into both a great character study of Snowden and a narrative that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it inexorably moves toward its conclusion.', u'release_date': u'2014-10-10', u'popularity': 0.955455, u'original_title': u'Citizenfour', u'backdrop_path': u'/fluGetObCo2FxoJ6KaUzMvtOxVc.jpg', u'vote_count': 225, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.9, u'genre_ids': [99], u'id': 293310, u'original_language': u'en'}
