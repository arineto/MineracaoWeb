Although it is the middle entry in Argento\'s so-called "Animal Trilogy" (along with The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Four Flies on Grey Velvet), the titular "cat o\' nine tails" does not directly refer to a literal cat, nor to a literal multi-tailed whip; rather, it refers to the number of leads that the protagonists follow in the attempt to solve a murder. Though successful in Europe it was dismissed in the United States. Argento admitted in the book Broken Mirrors, Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento that he was less than pleased with the film. In fact the director often cites it as his least favorite of his films.', u'release_date': u'1971-02-11', u'popularity': 1.383709, u'original_title': u'Il gatto a nove code', u'backdrop_path': u'/1oBibOY5hSO8kT7Liiav9sTQtj3.jpg', u'vote_count': 13, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [27, 9648, 53, 10769], u'id': 27431, u'original_language': u'it'}
