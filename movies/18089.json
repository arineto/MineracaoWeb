Jane Austen is about to turn forty, but she still hasn't found her ideal man. When Jane is approached by her niece Fanny and asked to help select the perfect husband for the young girl, the aging spinster begins to wonder why it is that she never found a man to share her own life with. Perhaps if Jane had accepted the proposal of a wealthy landowner she could have saved her family from financial ruin, and what of the handsome young physician who once warmed to Jane after tending to her ailing family members?", u'release_date': u'2008-02-03', u'popularity': 0.094477, u'original_title': u'Miss Austen Regrets', u'backdrop_path': u'/3qqOWfD3Ki4nYeeM0DlFdlMbCnX.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.5, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 18089, u'original_language': u'en'}
