Although they have no experience, the youths set their sights on a national robotics contest.

Along the way, the students learn not only how to build a robot but something far more important: how to forge bonds that will last a lifetime.", u'release_date': u'2015-01-16', u'popularity': 1.425314, u'original_title': u'Spare Parts', u'backdrop_path': u'/6NvcBVGch2EstnYDZDOxS0SqY1D.jpg', u'vote_count': 23, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.7, u'genre_ids': [28, 18, 10751], u'id': 264337, u'original_language': u'en'}
