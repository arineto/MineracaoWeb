He believes strongly in his mentor and the ways of the church but loses faith when he catches Lom strangling Reggie Nalder to death for calling him impotent. Kier begins to see for himself that the witch trials are nothing but a scam of the church to rob people of their land, money, and other personal belongings of value and seduce beautiful big breasted women. In the end, the towns people revolt, Herbert Lom escapes and poor Udo is tortured to death by the towns people with the his own torture devices. This film contains very strong graphic torture including a women's tongue being ripped out of her head, nuns being raped(in the opening credits), and lots of beatings.", u'release_date': u'1970-02-19', u'popularity': 1.192852, u'original_title': u'Hexen bis aufs Blut gequ\xe4lt', u'backdrop_path': u'/60pHls31F1xegBF19Xb3fMAPmG4.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.7, u'genre_ids': [27, 18, 36, 53], u'id': 39931, u'original_language': u'de'}
