{u'poster_path': u'/dHCeZEvqL3XQublbaCut97AAK4i.jpg', u'title': u'Eden', u'overview': u"The fourth feature from Mia Hansen-L\xf8ve is a rare achievement: an epically scaled work built on the purely ephemeral, breathlessly floating along on currents of feeling. Eden is based on the experiences of Hansen-L\xf8ve's brother (and co-writer) Sven, who was one of the pioneering DJs of the French rave scene in the early 1990s. Paul (F\xe9lix de Givry) and his friends, including Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter (otherwise known as Daft Punk), see visions of ecstasy in garage music-as their raves become more and more popular, they experience a grand democracy of pure bliss extending into infinity, only to dematerialize on contact with changing times and the demands of everyday life. Hansen-L\xf8ve's film plays in the mind as a swirl of beautiful faces and bodies, impulsive movements, rushes of cascading light and color (lensed by the great cameraman, Denis Lenoir), and music, music, and more music. Eden is a film that moves with the heartbeat of youth.", u'release_date': u'2014-11-19', u'popularity': 1.305497, u'original_title': u'Eden', u'backdrop_path': u'/rAE54t71qF7sTtlzqF7m4ptV1mV.jpg', u'vote_count': 13, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.8, u'genre_ids': [10402, 18], u'id': 283330, u'original_language': u'en'}
