Captain Canine is commander of space ship Megasis and is from the planet Inspiron. He is the mortal enemy of the Commander Drex. In charge of protecting Princess Jorala and the Five Power Rings from Drex, Megasis places the rings in hiding on the planet Earth, and takes the form of a German Shepherd, intending to stay on earth in very deep cover. Adopted by aspiring young comic book artist Ian Shaeffer, and renamed Captain Canine, he spends 16 happy years on Earth, as Ian recounts the stories of his space adventures. But when the five Buddies discover the Power Rings and instantly develop superpowers, Captain Canine has to train them very quickly indeed - for Commander Drex is headed back to earth, and this time he's determined to succeed.", u'release_date': u'2013-08-27', u'popularity': 0.323787, u'original_title': u'Super Buddies', u'backdrop_path': u'/unu6QXPqP9RWDxyA3frMwwbcmAx.jpg', u'vote_count': 22, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.5, u'genre_ids': [10751], u'id': 149910, u'original_language': u'en'}
