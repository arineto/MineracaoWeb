Maya, a young woman whose family has died, joins the group. Into the mix comes Shin, a thief who's killed a G.I. The women allow him to hide while recovering from wounds, but then he won't leave. Maya is drawn to him, discovering as she falls in love that she can feel again; she's now more fully human, but at the same time, she's endangered herself and her livelihood. Can she and Shin make it out of Tokyo to establish life as a couple?", u'release_date': u'1964-05-31', u'popularity': 1.226728, u'original_title': u'\u8089\u4f53\u306e\u9580', u'backdrop_path': u'/3FmivrxAPiwP3P4hRmfVVQQHKwP.jpg', u'vote_count': 3, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 3.3, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 86666, u'original_language': u'ja'}
