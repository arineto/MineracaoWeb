Uncle Mickey sends them money to survive. When Mickey's daughter Rita runs away from an asylum, Vivian's dad offers shelter to her if Mickey will pay for a plush flat. Vivian must babysit her adult cousin, making sure she gets to nursing school and avoids pills and booze. But Vivian has her own problems: she's curious about sex, likes an older neighbor kid, has inherited her mother's ample breasts, and wants a family that doesn't embarrass her. Can she help Rita, keep Uncle Mickey happy, and feel OK about her body and her family?", u'release_date': u'1998-08-14', u'popularity': 1.243914, u'original_title': u'Slums of Beverly Hills', u'backdrop_path': u'/l3cjRFKXaZR94dlhKsq8rQRwSpG.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [35, 18], u'id': 14662, u'original_language': u'en'}
