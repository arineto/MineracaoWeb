He tries doctor after doctor and shrink after shrink, but nothing works. The Golf Channel, lesbian exercise classes and a dizzying variety of pills get him through the day, but don't quite solve his problem. His writing partner tries everything to get him back to normal, but it's not until Hudson meets Sara that he finds a real motivation to get better and to actually start feeling again. From the writer of Deuce Bigalow, comes NUMB, a romantic comedy following an unusual man looking for strange love.", u'release_date': u'2007-04-30', u'popularity': 0.202178, u'original_title': u'Numb', u'backdrop_path': u'/85TZl6bQiQOkE8Y33JhdNBJd3kD.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749], u'id': 17106, u'original_language': u'en'}
