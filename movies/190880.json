This is the challenge Guillaume took up. The film recounts Guillaume's tragicomic battle from the young age of eight, as he adopts the role of a girl then of a homosexual... until, aged 30, he meets the woman who, after his mother, will become the other woman in his life. Beyond this story of a heterosexual coming-out, the film tells the tale of an actor who never stopped loving women, maybe even a little too much.", u'release_date': u'2013-11-20', u'popularity': 0.411638, u'original_title': u'Les Gar\xe7ons et Guillaume, \xe0 Table !', u'backdrop_path': u'/zzkCU58ub1QHQ9cVYznNExmdOyy.jpg', u'vote_count': 106, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.6, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 190880, u'original_language': u'fr'}
