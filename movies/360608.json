When Melissa Cooper's body is found hanging from a swing set, the 27-year-old's death is initially ruled a suicide. But two weeks later a young man, Adam, comes forward claiming he murdered Melissa on the orders of her husband, Daniel Cooper. Adam says that Daniel is the leader of an end times religious cult and that Daniel controls every aspect of the followers\u2019 lives. Daniel Cooper denies all wrongdoing in his wife's death, but other members of the \u201cChurch of the Blessed Light\u201d claim that the charismatic Daniel indeed has a secret life. Melissa's case is investigated, exploring what really went on behind closed doors in Daniel and Melissa's marriage, whether Adam acted on his own accord, if Melissa was killed on the orders of her fanatical, newlywed husband or, if Melissa was murdered at all.", u'release_date': u'2015-09-19', u'popularity': 1.097231, u'original_title': u'Ungodly Acts', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.0, u'genre_ids': [10770], u'id': 360608, u'original_language': u'en'}
