Loose-limbed spy Johnny Worricker, last seen whistleblowing at MI5 in Page Eight, has a new life. He is hiding out in Ray-Bans on the Caribbean islands of the title, eating lobster and calling himself Tom Eliot (he\u2019s a poet at heart). We\u2019re drawn into his world and his predicament when Christopher Walken strolls in as a shadowy American who claims to know Johnny. The encounter forces him into the company of some ambiguous American businessmen who claim to be on the islands for a conference on the global financial crisis. When one of them falls in the sea, their financial PR seems to know more than she's letting on. Worricker soon learns the extent of their shady activities and he must act quickly to survive when links to British prime minister Alec Beasley come to light.", u'release_date': u'2014-03-20', u'popularity': 0.659939, u'original_title': u'Turks & Caicos', u'backdrop_path': u'/8jpE0Y8InANvFz2FVKmliY4yCQY.jpg', u'vote_count': 19, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [28, 18, 9648, 53], u'id': 260202, u'original_language': u'en'}
