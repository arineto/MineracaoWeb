Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield and his wife, Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet the color of her skin prevents her from fully participating in the traditions of her social standing. Left to wonder if she will ever find love, Belle falls for an idealistic young vicar's son bent on change who, with her help, shapes Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England", u'release_date': u'2014-05-08', u'popularity': 2.071371, u'original_title': u'Belle', u'backdrop_path': u'/fDzkpDDh1JHFILC5LKveJqAYLHS.jpg', u'vote_count': 95, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 205601, u'original_language': u'en'}
