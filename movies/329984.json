{u'poster_path': u'/axTDsX71MKmYSxRrbqN7VvtTzYp.jpg', u'title': u'From Vegas to Macau II', u'overview': u"Chow Yun-fat is back as the titular gambler, Ken, with the magic hand. This time, the movie exaggerates his skills with CGI poker cards until it almost becomes a fantasy. But that's to be expected in a Wong Jing's movie. This time, the location is shifted to Thailand where Mark (Nick Cheung), an accountant in a money-laundering syndicate, DOA, is chased by Interpol and DOA. Ken has to save him and help his prot\xe9g\xe9, Vincent (Shawn Yue). Wong Jing tries to pack in everything that is entertaining into a 2 hours movie. Though it feels bloated, expect a lot of crazy and random fun. Don't expect a coherent story and character development and it will be an enjoyable entertainment. Action is ramped out. The action scene in the middle sees a break-in of the safe house with lots of explosion and gunfire. The movie's climax turns into a CGI set where a fight breaks out in an airplane. Music is serviceable. Direction and acting is fine too.", u'release_date': u'2015-02-19', u'popularity': 1.193222, u'original_title': u'\u8ced\u57ce\u98a8\u96f2II', u'backdrop_path': u'/at32pGu41ZYYJIZFATrQan2e1b0.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.3, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 329984, u'original_language': u'cn'}
