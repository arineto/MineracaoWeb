{u'poster_path': u'/kOfSTm2cftavsyB49amnhW3is9y.jpg', u'title': u'Point of No Return', u'overview': u"Hardened criminal Maggie Hayward's consistent violence, even in police custody, ends in the execution chamber. However, top-secret US government agent 'Bob' arranges a staged death, so Maggie can be elaborately trained as a phantom killer and subdued into obedience. She gets a new cover identity as saleswoman Claudia Anne Doran. She also gets a wonderful house-mate, building super J.P., a broad-minded, gentle photographer. The two fall in love, and that complicates hit jobs. His good influence extends to breeding in her a conscience that places love over business, unlike Bob's agency.", u'release_date': u'1993-03-19', u'popularity': 0.589174, u'original_title': u'Point of No Return', u'backdrop_path': u'/kRpHALFrB91iY3hd3zoUWztDFLy.jpg', u'vote_count': 39, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 53], u'id': 10498, u'original_language': u'en'}
