Ever since she saw Bryce's baby blues back in second grade, Juli has been smitten. Unfortunately, Bryce has never felt the same. Frankly, he thinks Juli Baker is a little weird--after all, what kind of freak raises chickens and sits in trees for fun? Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see that Juli's unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool. And Juli starts to think that maybe Bryce's brilliant blue eyes are as empty as the rest of Bryce seems to be. After all, what kind of jerk doesn't care about other people's feelings about chickens and trees? With Flipped, mystery author Wendelin Van Draanen has taken a break from her Sammy Keyes series, and the result is flipping fantastic.", u'release_date': u'2010-08-06', u'popularity': 0.143325, u'original_title': u'Flipped', u'backdrop_path': u'/29DDoPM1qV6DqLUfNAY9jRhd7sR.jpg', u'vote_count': 136, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10749], u'id': 43949, u'original_language': u'en'}
