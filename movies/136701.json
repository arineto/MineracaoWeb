Several years later, after taking the Han Emperor under his wing, Cao crowns himself King of Wei. He built a magnificent Bronze Sparrow Island to symbolize his power and rumors spread that he would replace the Emperor. Meanwhile, young lovers Mu Shun (Hiroshi Tamaki) and Ling Ju (Liu Yi-Fei) are taken from a prison camp to a hidden tomb, where they spend five cruel years together, training as assassins for a secret mission. In the year 220 BC astronomical signs predict dramatic change. As a result, Cao's son Cao Pi (Yau Sam-Chi) and Cao's followers urge Cao to become the new Emperor - but unknown opposing forces plot against him.", u'release_date': u'2012-09-26', u'popularity': 0.096601, u'original_title': u'Tong que tai', u'backdrop_path': u'/93fBHOSQGKaWuSFFnkNJGgYjG5Z.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.7, u'genre_ids': [18, 36], u'id': 136701, u'original_language': u'en'}
