{u'poster_path': u'/vjTLLA9rGEMjbx6ckvYOXUf2gX8.jpg', u'title': u'The Rise', u'overview': u"Battered, bruised and under arrest, Harvey Denton (Luke Treadaway) sits in a police interview room facing interrogation. Clutching a stack of eyewitness statements, Detective Inspector West (Timothy Spall) has no doubt in Harvey's part in a foiled robbery, and his subsequent attempted murder of local businessman Steven Roper. Denying everything, Harvey agrees to tell his version of events in full. We take in his release from prison a month earlier, and the malevolent, unjust act that put him in there. We see his emotional reunion with his sibling-like best friends, and the immovable loyalty they have for one another. We see the rekindling of a lost love, a second chance for two people meant for each other. We see the ingenious planning of the ill-fated robbery, the amazing twist, the shocking outcome and the real driving force behind it - retribution. What unfolds is an exhilerating, moving and hilarious story of loyalty, jealousy, friendship, revenge and the pursuit of happiness.", u'release_date': u'2013-07-26', u'popularity': 1.135194, u'original_title': u'The Rise', u'backdrop_path': u'/a3nMiSpY7zO3uVNWGmgxKpsbhKk.jpg', u'vote_count': 11, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [53, 18, 80], u'id': 128241, u'original_language': u'en'}
