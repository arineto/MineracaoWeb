{u'poster_path': u'/vYjQxygFvePv3Z08o8W1Djw0s9u.jpg', u'title': u'Murmur of the Heart', u'overview': u"This is a jolly coming-of-age story about a 15-year-old boy named Laurent Chevalier who is growing up in bourgeois surroundings in Dijon, France. This is France in the mid-1950s rather than America in the 1990s. Thus, Laurent is unharmed by events which would irreparably shatter the self-esteem of a modern American adolescent: he gets drunk, he smokes, he has sex, he is smothered by his mother, he is ignored by his father, a priest makes a pass at him, he gets rheumatoid fever, etc. There's enough scandalous behavior in this film to make 100 made-for-TV movies, and yet this is a very happy and oddly innocent tale.", u'release_date': u'1971-01-01', u'popularity': 1.245984, u'original_title': u'Le souffle au coeur', u'backdrop_path': u'/ivdcekW24c80gBCvGI8WCGz7K9a.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10769, 10749], u'id': 42501, u'original_language': u'fr'}
