Here he runs into a hodge-podge of people of differing ethnicities, all of them victims of the government's earlier mania for relocating and eliminating whole ethnic groups and classes of people. These desperately unhappy people are unable to find any pleasure in this diverse companionship, but instead are antagonistic to it, and often resort to desperate measures in their doomed attempts to ease their pain.", u'release_date': u'1988-01-01', u'popularity': 0.097631, u'original_title': u'\u0414\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f', u'backdrop_path': u'/fnLlEiBMupP4wl91gXIFnwPJXD6.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 3.9, u'genre_ids': [18, 878], u'id': 45886, u'original_language': u'en'}
