Powered by sun and earth, designed by the greatest architectural visionary of the new millennium, Elysium is a self contained world. A world of commerce, cuisine and entertainment, featuring restaurants, swimming pools, libraries, cinemas, even a research hospital. It is not just the tallest and most technologically advanced work of modern architecture, but one that embodies the world's highest aspirations.  Dr. Robert Laing, a new arrival, settles in and adjusts to this hermetic life. But before long he becomes aware of something unsettling in the building. In an escalating atmosphere of unrest the residents break into tribal factions. Laing watches in horror as the myth of a utopian society is shattered.", u'release_date': u'2015-09-21', u'popularity': 0.200289, u'original_title': u'High Rise', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.9, u'genre_ids': [28, 18, 878], u'id': 254302, u'original_language': u'en'}
