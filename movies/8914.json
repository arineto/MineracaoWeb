Dr. Susan McAlester genetically engineers three Mako sharks, intending to increase their brain capacity so that they can harvest the tissue as a cure for Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, the increased brain capacity also makes the sharks smarter, faster, and more dangerous. Aquatica's financial backers are skeptical and nervous about the tests, and send a corporate executive to visit the facility.", u'release_date': u'1999-07-27', u'popularity': 0.674883, u'original_title': u'Deep Blue Sea', u'backdrop_path': u'/adGAeyRgc7jQyXaBFyQGWGCrdJo.jpg', u'vote_count': 210, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.3, u'genre_ids': [28, 27, 878, 53], u'id': 8914, u'original_language': u'en'}
