Their only weapon, they discover, is booze. If they want to survive the creatures\u2019 onslaught, everyone will have to get very, very drunk!', u'release_date': u'2012-12-26', u'popularity': 0.117752, u'original_title': u'Grabbers', u'backdrop_path': u'/j1PN1v9eP1y1mwkVLA0dcIwhM6g.jpg', u'vote_count': 36, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.8, u'genre_ids': [35, 27, 878, 53], u'id': 84204, u'original_language': u'en'}
