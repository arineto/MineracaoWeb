Mahmud (Omid Djalili \u2013 star comic, Sex and The City 2) is a loving husband, doting father and an admittedly \u201crelaxed\u201d Muslim. A normal guy living an everyday life. That is until a chance discovery turns his life upside down, throwing him into a full-scale identity crisis: it turns out he\u2019s adopted, and was actually born Jewish. Featuring an all-star cast of Djalili, Richard Schiff (The West Wing), Matt Lucas (Little Britain), Archie Panjabi (The Good Wife) and Miranda Hart (BBC2\u2019s Miranda), The Infidel is a hilarious and feel good story that will have you roaring with laughter.
