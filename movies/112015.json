He surrounds himself with toys from drugs to race cars to Dahlia (Krista Ranillo), who is more a girl toy than a girlfriend. A one night stand with Viveca gives Andre the speed he has been looking for: a forbidden love affair with a very attractive married woman. He pursues Viveca like there is no tomorrow. Viveca tries to distance herself from Andre, but he proves to be too stubborn for her. Complications upon complications set it. Should Viveca remain secretive of what is happening or continue living a life of deceit.', u'release_date': u'2002-11-06', u'popularity': 1.211972, u'original_title': u'Two Timer', u'backdrop_path': None, u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [28, 18], u'id': 112015, u'original_language': u'en'}
