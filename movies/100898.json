{u'poster_path': u'/60MFwKLf9wgTRZTKLR5YSec4T2M.jpg', u'title': u'North Sea Texas', u'overview': u'Pim lives in a run-down house in a dead-end street somewhere at the Belgian coast, together with his mother Yvette Bulteel. Life here smells of cold French fries, cheap cigarettes, vermouth and stale beer. Mother Yvette uses her fat Etienne with his lousy grey Fiat as a driver for the nights she has to \u201cperform\u201d.  As a kid Pim dreams of a better life, imagining princesses and beauty queens. But when Pim turns 16 he dreams of Gino, the boy next door, instead. Ever since they were children there has been this tension between them. Now Gino is Pim\u2019s motorcycling hero. Cold mockery, little humiliations and tiny bits of hope make up Pim\u2019s life. No wonder he sometimes flees to his dream world.', u'release_date': u'2011-03-16', u'popularity': 1.102067, u'original_title': u'Noordzee, Texas', u'backdrop_path': u'/ev7aQyHCUlebr6MKjhVIQJeJK8l.jpg', u'vote_count': 28, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 100898, u'original_language': u'nl'}
