The two dress up as rabbis as they try to elude not only assasins from Slimane's country, but also the police, who think Pivert is a murderer. Pivert ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob, a beloved figure who's returned to France for his first visit after 30 years in the United States. Adding to the confusion are Pivert's dentist-wife, who thinks her husband is leaving her for another woman, their daughter, who's about to get married, and a Parisian neighborhood filled with people eager to celebrate the return of Rabbi Jacob.", u'release_date': u'1973-10-18', u'popularity': 1.171274, u'original_title': u'Les aventures de Rabbi Jacob', u'backdrop_path': u'/6fu81IiwYzM3BZ39b1vP3AsDbjC.jpg', u'vote_count': 42, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.8, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 760, u'original_language': u'fr'}
