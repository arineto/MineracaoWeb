In order to find a new lead, Nelson travels to New York City to inform widowed magazine reporter Rebecca Scott that her long dead husband, Miles, had only recently been murdered to see if she had heard from him in recent years. Perplexed, Scott joins Agent Nelson in the wealthy enclave of Australia\u2019s Gold Coast to find out what really happened. The two soon discover Miles may have been part of an elaborate \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d to bilk investors, and a vengeful billionaire, out of millions of dollars.
