No one imagines this could lead to serial murders, but two days after the first murder, another homicide occurs. A woman is suffocated to death and the only evidence left at the crime scene is a sticker of the cartoon character "Princess Aurora". A veteran detective OH suspects an attractive and lively woman named JUNG Soon-jung as the murderer. However, he does not tell anyone -not even his partner- that Jung also happens to be his ex-wife. Again and again, the Princess Aurora sticker is found... each with a dead body.', u'release_date': u'2005-10-27', u'popularity': 0.132503, u'original_title': u'\uc624\ub85c\ub77c \uacf5\uc8fc', u'backdrop_path': u'/j9kTnjOiFIiFWFE7kGVAY461gJY.jpg', u'vote_count': 7, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.2, u'genre_ids': [80, 18, 9648], u'id': 38054, u'original_language': u'ko'}
