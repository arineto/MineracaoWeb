When he died, he died as he lived, with a smile on his face watching a horse race on which he had bet, with borrowed money. But before he died he had a final request, 'Last Orders', that his ashes be scattered in the sea at Margate. The movie follows his mates, Ray, Lenny and Vic and his foster son Vince as they journey to the sea with the ashes. Along the way, the threads of their lives, their loves and their disappointments are woven together in their memories of Jack and his wife Amy", u'release_date': u'2001-09-10', u'popularity': 1.107753, u'original_title': u'Last Orders', u'backdrop_path': u'/mx2O1eHTg9nVMAMM3Xh8S56AseJ.jpg', u'vote_count': 8, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 18, 10769], u'id': 14778, u'original_language': u'en'}
