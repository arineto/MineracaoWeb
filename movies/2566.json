Decisions: treatment? work? how to tell his lover and his family. He remembers the sea and himself as a child. He stares in the mirror. He's cruel: facing death, he pushes people away - what's the point? He visits his grandmother to tell her; on the way, he chats briefly with a waitress. He looks at old photos, visits a childhood tree house. He takes pictures. Returning from his grandmother's, he stops for food and sees the waitress, Jany, again. She makes a request. He returns to an empty flat - his lover has left. Can Jany's proposition give him a way to move past self-pity?", u'release_date': u'2005-05-16', u'popularity': 0.139364, u'original_title': u'Le temps qui reste', u'backdrop_path': u'/lXd3qWW3Ou3kdOSq5wSsq2QtW07.jpg', u'vote_count': 10, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.3, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 2566, u'original_language': u'en'}
