Sure enough, that very night she meets the ghost of crusty former owner Captain Gregg...and refuses to be scared off. Indeed, they become friends and allies, after Lucy gets used to the idea of a man's ghost haunting her bedroom. But when a charming live man comes courting, Lucy and the captain must deal with their feelings for each other.", u'release_date': u'1947-06-26', u'popularity': 1.138448, u'original_title': u'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir', u'backdrop_path': u'/7cvj25eD6exK6DY2SNPw5TXBb9e.jpg', u'vote_count': 16, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, u'genre_ids': [18, 14, 9648, 10749, 53], u'id': 22292, u'original_language': u'en'}
