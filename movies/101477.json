{u'poster_path': u'/mUjmOuEXkKr6qoBdUq0z7rZqS7h.jpg', u'title': u'Thank You Mask Man', u'overview': u'This short animation set to Lenny Bruce\'s live monologue tells how the Lone Ranger hooks up with Tonto. With Bruce doing all the voices, this animation begins with local folks upset at the Lone Ranger because he won\'t stay around to be thanked after a good deed. So, he stays and finds he likes hearing "Thank you mask man." When their attention starts to shift elsewhere, he shocks and disgusts the townspeople with a final request.  According to the cartoon\u2019s producer John Magnuson, at early showings of this, gay audiences were upset by its apparent \u201cfag-bashing\u201d. And it\u2019s true, part of the fun of the piece is just crying out \u201cMasked man\u2019s a fag\u201d, scandalising and defacing the image of this all-American hero. But it\u2019s within the larger context of Bruce\u2019s analysis of heroism, and that the towns people reject the Masked Man is because of their prejudices, not because Bruce is asking us to endorse them.
