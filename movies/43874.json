{u'poster_path': u'/guKfZyFyvB1k79KZIibpsBw2hLs.jpg', u'title': u'Camille', u'overview': u"Life in 1847 Paris is as spirited as champagne and as unforgiving as the gray morning after. In gambling dens and lavish soirees, men of means exert their wills and women turned courtesans exult in pleasure. One such woman is Marguerite Gautier (Greta Garbo), the Camille of this sumptuous romance tale based on the enduring Alexandre Dumas story. Garbo's aloof mystique and alabaster beauty illuminate this George Cukor-directed film featuring what many call her finest performance. Her Camille is a movie paragon of true love found (in suitor Armand Duval, memorably played by Robert Taylor), then sacrificed for a greater good. Garbo earned an Academy Award nomination and the New York Film Critics Best Actress Award for her memorable work.", u'release_date': u'1936-12-12', u'popularity': 0.190117, u'original_title': u'Camille', u'backdrop_path': u'/gcj6uOSS9pdsgfCBx4r3bXXIsoi.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 4.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 43874, u'original_language': u'en'}
