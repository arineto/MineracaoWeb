Sixty-ish spouses Vladimir and Elena uneasily share his palatial Moscow apartment -- he\'s a still-virile, wealthy businessman, she\'s his former nurse who has "married up." Estranged from his own wild-child daughter, Vladimir openly despises his wife\'s freeloading son and family. But when a sudden illness and an unexpected reunion threaten the dutiful housewife\'s potential inheritance, she must hatch a desperate plan...  Masterfully crafted by award-winning Russian filmmaker Andrey Zvyagintsev, featuring evocative, Hitchcockian music by Philip Glass, Elena is a subtly stylish exploration of crime, punishment, and human nature.', u'release_date': u'2011-05-21', u'popularity': 1.522186, u'original_title': u'\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430', u'backdrop_path': u'/vtgrr328MaAKgXhxt2y5ub8OAZH.jpg', u'vote_count': 21, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.2, u'genre_ids': [18, 53], u'id': 78182, u'original_language': u'ru'}
