{u'poster_path': u'/29YNjX87qWSRMqVn5Vgpwk1zWdO.jpg', u'title': u'Attila Marcel', u'overview': u"Paul is a sweet man-child, raised \u2014 and smothered \u2014 by his two eccentric aunts in Paris since the death of his parents when he was a toddler. Now thirty-three, he still does not speak. (He does express himself through colourful suits that would challenge any Wes Anderson character in nerd chic.) Paul's aunts have only one dream for him: to win piano competitions. Although Paul practices dutifully, he remains unfulfilled until he submits to the interventions of his upstairs neighbour. Suitably named after the novelist, Madame Proust offers Paul a concoction that unlocks repressed memories from his childhood and awakens the most delightful of fantasies.", u'release_date': u'2013-11-06', u'popularity': 0.10229, u'original_title': u'Attila Marcel', u'backdrop_path': u'/1ht9Y2o44pFqgtJ1Yms9VEsYRjx.jpg', u'vote_count': 6, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 18], u'id': 186729, u'original_language': u'en'}
