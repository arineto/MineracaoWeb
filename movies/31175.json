When his girlfriend Nadine up and moves to Shanghai, a love-sick Zinos decides to fly after her, leaving his restaurant in the hands of his unreliable ex-con brother Illias. Both decisions turn out disastrous: Illias gambles away the restaurant to a shady real estate agent, and Zinos finds Nadine with a new lover. If the brothers can stop arguing and get it together, the Soul Kitchen might still have one last chance at staying in business. The mayhem that follows is a hilariously entertaining story of self-realization, set to an irresistibly soulful soundtrack.', u'release_date': u'2009-09-09', u'popularity': 1.410914, u'original_title': u'Soul Kitchen', u'backdrop_path': u'/w4Adznvm4b3moVXrzbuIDPLuq32.jpg', u'vote_count': 49, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.2, u'genre_ids': [18, 35], u'id': 31175, u'original_language': u'de'}
