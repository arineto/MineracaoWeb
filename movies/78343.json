{u'poster_path': u'/mPPakcydncdlGt6dKzcdNICAnpZ.jpg', u'title': u'Comrade', u'overview': u'Nice little story about an adolescent boy who runs off to live with his sister, whom his dad turned out three years before. He befriends her nutso neighbor: an aging Commie who is determined to defend his hovel from the authorities. This offbeat story is well played, if a bit slow. The kid is not strong enough to drive the film, so it begins to seem somewhat contrived.', u'release_date': u'2006-05-18', u'popularity': 1.426927, u'original_title': u'Bekarov, Yikre Lekha Mashehu Tov', u'backdrop_path': u'/rZg3mQkI2qY5wRAiDEPdX3WYgT4.jpg', u'vote_count': 0, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 0.0, u'genre_ids': [18, 28, 10769], u'id': 78343, u'original_language': u'en'}
