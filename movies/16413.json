It\xb4s not long before Schucks discovers his new boss, Jack Paddaman, is as crooked as they come, but it\xb4s too late: the employment contract is signed and sealed.A year passes, and Schucks is no better off. However, his candid camera videos, which poke fun at all sectors of post-1994 South Africa, prove a big hit with stressed-out government ministers. When the president asks Paddaman to make a movie to benefit street children, Schucks and his pals do all the hard work while Paddaman plans how he can get hold of the profits from the video sales. Add a scatterbrained secretary, a lovelorn traffic cop and a cunning street child and you have a roll-in-the aisles comedy with a distinctly South African flavour.', u'release_date': u'1996-11-29', u'popularity': 0.098417, u'original_title': u'Panic Mechanic', u'backdrop_path': u'/abK8jDLCWCgujmEQW489tKtLiJD.jpg', u'vote_count': 2, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [35], u'id': 16413, u'original_language': u'en'}
