Nina, who\'s come to Paris to act and sleeps with any man at hand, meets Paulot, a young estate agent; he\'s smitten. She also meets Paulot\'s flatmate Quentin, a compulsive who stalks her. To Paulot\'s jealous dismay, she\'s willing to sleep with Quentin, and wants Paulot\'s friendship. After a desperate act by Quentin, Nina and Paulot share a flat, but she still won\'t take him as a lover; instead, her energy goes into a production of "Romeo and Juliet" directed by a detached, intense man who becomes her father figure.
