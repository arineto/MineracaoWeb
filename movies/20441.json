When John accidentally discovers a hidden compartment in the barn, he finds a creepy scarecrow but his son Michael makes him promise to destroy it. However, his neighbor Jude Weatherby visits him, gives a six-pack of beer to the abstemious John and convinces him to put the scarecrow in the cornfield. Out of the blue, the life of John changes: the crows die; the pump works again irrigating the land; and the banker responsible for the closure has an accident and dies. However, he feels that his land is possessed by something evil that is threatening his beloved family.', u'release_date': u'2009-07-21', u'popularity': 1.141805, u'original_title': u'The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow', u'backdrop_path': u'/1EH3ofa6kKCgrByRQpHgCXSz9Y.jpg', u'vote_count': 15, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.2, u'genre_ids': [27], u'id': 20441, u'original_language': u'en'}
