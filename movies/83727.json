One night, she sees that the front door is slightly ajar and impulsively decides to sneak inside. But there in the dark, decrepit auditorium, a show unlike any other unfolds before her eyes. Its host is an eerie human puppet named Peg Poett who will introduce Penny to six tales of the bizarre: A couple traveling in a remote part of the French Pyrenees cross paths with a lustful witch; A paranoid lover faces the wrath of a partner who has been pushed to her limit; The Freudian dreams of an unfaithful husband blur the lines between fantasy and reality; The horrors of the real world are interpreted through the mind of a child; A woman addicted to other people's memories gets her fix through the vitreous fluid of her victims' eyeballs; And a perverse obsession with sweets turns sour for a couple in too deep.", u'release_date': u'2011-07-15', u'popularity': 0.41818, u'original_title': u'The Theatre Bizarre', u'backdrop_path': u'/4FByzh1uuQbCO2fGsoNV9McLvqy.jpg', u'vote_count': 14, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [27], u'id': 83727, u'original_language': u'en'}
