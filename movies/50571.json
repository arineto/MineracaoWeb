Although abundantly trained in the martial arts, he is no match for Master San Te, the creator of the 36th Chamber of Shaolin, who constantly overpowers his younger, more agile disciples in matters of both body and mind. Exhausted by his frequent defeats, Fong seeks to escape his prison and crosses paths with a governor, who rewards him with a yellow robe granting immunity from any Manchu. But what are the governor's true intentions? Will Fong feed his foolish ego and betray the Shaolin Temple?", u'release_date': u'1985-01-01', u'popularity': 0.241174, u'original_title': u'Pi li shi jie', u'backdrop_path': u'/8hYIxgchT2vpZO3onaeQQPwvgTa.jpg', u'vote_count': 5, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.6, u'genre_ids': [28, 10769], u'id': 50571, u'original_language': u'zh'}
