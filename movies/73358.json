{u'poster_path': u'/4WdJmlY03tktC7B6UM8sHxPfPcw.jpg', u'title': u'Page Eight', u'overview': u'Page Eight is lovingly turned, with elegant writing, a flawless cast and a heartfelt message from writer/director David Hare about the danger zone where spies and politicians meet.  The tension builds gently as we follow the fortunes of Johnny Worricker, a jazz-loving charmer who works high up at MI5 as an intelligence analyst. It\u2019s a part made for Bill Nighy and he purrs out bon mots with a weary panache that women 20 years younger find irresistible. One such is his neighbour, Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz), in a Battersea mansion block. The question for Johnny is whether her interest in him is genuine or hides something darker.  As his boss (Michael Gambon) puts it: \u201cDistrust is a terrible habit.\u201d Questions of trust, honour and friendship rumble through the play. The characters exchange oblique repartee as a plot about a damning dossier unwinds. It\u2019s not to be missed.', u'release_date': u'2011-08-28', u'popularity': 1.591689, u'original_title': u'Page Eight', u'backdrop_path': u'/A3lnBkzYcCgSRGVcuj7KbliLEHc.jpg', u'vote_count': 24, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.4, u'genre_ids': [9648, 53, 18], u'id': 73358, u'original_language': u'en'}
