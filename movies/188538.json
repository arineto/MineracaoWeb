The more Molly (Alexis Bledel) gets to know Gus (Zachary Levi), the more she's intrigued by him. But she's also mystified. Gus is absent-minded, preoccupied. Is he hiding something? The short answer is: yes. He's reluctant to share with her that since suffering a brain aneurysm, he's totally lost his short-term memory. Every day is a brand new day, his life starts anew. Every day he sees Molly he struggles to remember who she is and what she represents. Every day, he has to fall in love with her all over again.", u'release_date': u'2013-04-21', u'popularity': 1.145427, u'original_title': u'Remember Sunday', u'backdrop_path': u'/44UPkr5R9s02HscbVS3CLUun0eK.jpg', u'vote_count': 32, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.9, u'genre_ids': [10770, 10749, 18], u'id': 188538, u'original_language': u'en'}
