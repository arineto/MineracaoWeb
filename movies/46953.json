When Martin's pal Micke suggests they get jobs together as waiters at a resort off the Swedish coast, Martin is all for it, but before long Micke finds better things to do and Martin is left on his own. The presence of pretty fellow server Jenny is a major consolation, but to his surprise, guileless Martin is soon chosen as the prot\xe9g\xe9 of G\xf6sta, the resort's short-tempered manager. G\xf6sta clearly likes Martin and makes him his right hand man, which gives Martin a crash course in the seedy side of life when he discovers G\xf6sta has a number of other business interests, not all of which are legal or ethical.", u'release_date': u'2010-09-10', u'popularity': 0.113443, u'original_title': u'Himlen \xe4r oskyldigt bl\xe5', u'backdrop_path': u'/9HKJVBoHbIda51KdsVPcUf2dusc.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [18, 10769], u'id': 46953, u'original_language': u'en'}
