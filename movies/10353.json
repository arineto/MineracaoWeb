Godefroy de Montmirail travels to today to recover the missing family jewels and a sacred relic, guarantor of his wife-to-be's fertility. The confrontation between Godefroy's repellent servant Jack the Crack and his descendent, the effete Jacquart, present-day owner of the chateau, further complicates the matter.", u'release_date': u'1998-02-11', u'popularity': 1.408288, u'original_title': u'Les visiteurs II - Les couloirs du temps', u'backdrop_path': u'/34LXoUgXYiKnznThMadXQwfhlPv.jpg', u'vote_count': 51, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.1, u'genre_ids': [35, 14], u'id': 10353, u'original_language': u'fr'}
