Because something fleeting and futureless is not necessarrily pathetic or trivial. A brief crossing, perhaps an initiatory trip. Filming a guy\'s "first time", filming him like a girl. Gut level skin deep... Nostalgia for vast ocean liners, for places "beyond the law" where you can venture outside of life, safe within an interlude. Describing a passion while respecting classical tragedy\'s unity of time and place, setting the stage for the eternal play of Masculine/Feminine. A hot-blooded Latin temperatment versus an apparently cool English one. A ship - one night - Sudden intimacy between an Englishwoman whose complexion is frosted by bitterness and a teenager whose gaze glows like ardent coals.', u'release_date': u'2001-03-06', u'popularity': 1.151822, u'original_title': u'Br\xe8ve travers\xe9e', u'backdrop_path': u'/lcR3wNKTKEV2erVYgpkkFIxWGHp.jpg', u'vote_count': 4, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 5.5, u'genre_ids': [18, 10749], u'id': 39770, u'original_language': u'en'}
