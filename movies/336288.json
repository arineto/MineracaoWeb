But when they embark upon a local rite of passage - traveling north for one final weekend of debauchery together - it just might prove to be their final weekend PERIOD, as this rite is doomed to go frightfully wrong. When they find themselves ensnared in a struggle for survival amongst a sinister hunting party, a bloodthirsty tribe AND a mythical beast, what began as a comedy of errors devolves into an all-out Darwinian duel to the death, and less than 24 hours will pass before a slew of lives have been claimed and the last of the living remains.', u'release_date': u'2015-10-06', u'popularity': 1.09651, u'original_title': u'American Backwoods: Slew Hampshire', u'backdrop_path': u'/xWF5LkoROL24ZTLACkyhSF4yxwV.jpg', u'vote_count': 1, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 10.0, u'genre_ids': [35, 27, 53], u'id': 336288, u'original_language': u'en'}
