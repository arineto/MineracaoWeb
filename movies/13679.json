The movie is set while Kirikou is still a child and Karaba is still a sorceress. Like Princes et princesses and Les Contes de la nuit, it is an anthology film comprising several episodic stories, each of them describing Kirikou's interactions with a different animals. It is however unique among Michel Ocelot's films, not only in that it is co-directed by B\xe9n\xe9dicte Galup (who has previously worked with him as an animator) but also for each of the stories being written by a different person (in all other cases, Ocelot has been the sole writer and director of his films).", u'release_date': u'2005-12-07', u'popularity': 1.112326, u'original_title': u'Kirikou et les b\xeates sauvages', u'backdrop_path': u'/uOUe8zDUeMJDNH8E0nzdBspq4Dv.jpg', u'vote_count': 15, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 6.0, u'genre_ids': [12, 16, 10751], u'id': 13679, u'original_language': u'en'}
