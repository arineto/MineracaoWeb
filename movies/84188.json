Sandra is a middle-aged manager at a fast-food restaurant; Becky is a teenaged counter girl who really needs the job. One stressful day (too many customers and too little bacon), a police officer calls, accusing Becky of stealing money from a customer\u2019s purse, which she vehemently denies. Sandra, overwhelmed by her managerial responsibilities, complies with the officer\u2019s orders to detain Becky.
