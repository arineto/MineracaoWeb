He is reunited with the state's senior senator--presidential hopeful and childhood hero, Senator Joseph Paine. In Washington, however, Smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor. Taylor first tries to corrupt Smith and then later attempts to destroy Smith through a scandal.", u'release_date': u'1939-10-19', u'popularity': 0.455933, u'original_title': u'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', u'backdrop_path': u'/dwy7iMMePSfSNXvahTQPmygot1g.jpg', u'vote_count': 54, u'video': False, u'adult': False, u'vote_average': 7.4, u'genre_ids': [18], u'id': 3083, u'original_language': u'en'}
