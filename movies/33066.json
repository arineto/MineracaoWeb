The First Farewell Tour', u'overview': u'An enormously popular performer who cut his teeth as the drummer for Genesis, where he eventually replaced Peter Gabriel as the singer, Phil Collins has gone on to a solo career that has garnered him icon status. His solo single "In the Air Tonight" was a hit both stateside and in his native UK, and he has since become a household name, with his instantly recognizable, expressive voice, haunting lyrics, and musical virtuosity. This documentary is a record of Collins\' Final Farewell Tour as it pulls up in Paris, where he delivers an energetic, heartfelt rendition of many of his most-loved tunes. Rounding out the bill are 22 music videos, representing virtually all of his #1 Billboard singles, including "Against All Odds," "One More Night," "Separate Lives," "Sussudio," "A Groovy Kind of Love," Another Day in Paris," and "Two Hearts." Plenty of backstage and documentary footage, and a photo gallery, complete the documentary.', u'release_date': u'2004-06-15', u'popularity': 1.106775, u'original_title': u'Phil Collins:  Finally...
